The room was dark and the mattress was like a brick. The water from the shower goes all over the bathroom. Everything was clean and the staff were incredibly nice. But I would definitely look at staying somewhere else if I were you………………………….,2.0

"This hotel is a marvel, I am very happy to have had the chance to stay there.  Everything is perfect, the welcome, the service, the friendliness of the staff, the splendor of the place...  An idyllic setting, improbably beautiful and refined, the buffet by the pool is stunning in terms of quality and variety.  Impossible to go to Casablanca without going through the Movenpik hotel It is in the city center all the places are surrounded by you, It is a great quality.  The place has an indescribable charm, All the staff are friendly and helpful Plus we met a charming girl called Aicha at the 16th floor restaurant She is too gallant And most importantly she works with a professional spirit.  You have to live it to understand it.  I recommend this palace where the staff will welcome you in the best possible way.  thank you for everything…",5.0
"I would like to share my wonderful experience and stay at the hotel , my friend and I came all the way from Canada and stayed at the hotel , it was  beautiful hotel with a great view and  spacious rooms that are very clean and a very caring staff. our guide suggested us to try the Spa and it was wonderful,  we were blessed to be taken care of by two amazing and caring girls Aicha and Hasna that i want to thank a lot for their kindness and professionalism , the Hamame and Spa were very good thanks to this wonderful girls. A great professional team in all departments thanks to a good conductor, one of the best managing directors ever met, always present. our stay in the hotel was very enjoyable and i recommende everyone to try it.",5.0
"During our stay in Casablanca my wife contracted Covid. We had to extend our stay at the Movenpick Hotel, cancel and rebook a new flight and arrange airport transportation. The Chief Concierge Hassan Zouhdy was most helpful in aiding us to make these arrangements. We were most grateful for his expertise which served to relieve some of the anxiety associated with these changes.",5.0
"The serving staff at the pool bar (Arnele or Arnold) was awesome. He provided top notch service . Also, the head concierge Hassan was very helpful, he assisted us with local restaurants and taxi information. ",4.0
"Amazing and relaxing stay at Casablanca is guaranteed at Mövenpick. If you tired after hot day just jump in the rooftop pool on 16th floor.  As well bar, pool service and lovely restaurant “16ème Floor” to your service.  Thank you for special care of Hassan and of course super service minded, always smiling and always for you service Armel!! You are a rising star! Thank you! You made my stay!  I had a amazing and lovely stay!  I strongly recommend Mövenpick for your stay.  As negative things during the stay, as I am Accor Diamond member I am extremely disappointed that hotel tried to sell me late check out, explaining it is General Manager (GM) design. (Room was available that why it was for sale otherwise hotel can not sale late check out if next guest check in soon). I…",4.0
"Hotel staff were inexperienced and did not seem to know how to do their jobs. Front desk did not pay attention to details, sky bar broke a bottle next to us and left glass all over without bothering to clean it up and spa was the worst experience I ever had in the world. I question the validity of the masseuse.",1.0
"I am staying with a travel group at this hotel in Casablanca. I had a problem because the lens in my eyeglasses came out. I went to the concierge, Hassan, to see if they might help me with my problem. He immediately told me of a close by optician then he actually walked me there and my glasses were quickly fixed. The service provided by Hassan was wonderful. This hotel really cares about their guests!",5.0
"The property is one of the most beautiful places I ever had the pleasure to stay at. Very well decorated, beautiful garden and just the most calming atmosphere ever. Everything was just fantastic! First time here and hope to come back more times. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms very well decorated, the pool is amazing and the food at the restaurant also. The bar was fantastic with a great menu selection plus fantastic service. This bring me to the next topic... the restaurant. We loved the food. There was nothing we ate that we did not like. Everything was tasty and cooked with fresh produce, the service overall was fantastic, everyone was very attentive and thinking ahead which made our stay effortless. A beautiful girl there named Aisha greeted me very warmly.  She's so cute…",5.0
"Pros: Reception is spacious, breakfast was nice and staff were attentive. Housekeeping were responsive. The roof top restaurant greatttt service. Especially, Essafa  @ Le seizieme, what a gentleman! Very attentive, went above and beyond. English was excellent, he is so hard working and made our visit feel like we were family ! Well done Essafa, I’d recommend the restaurant due to to you! The food was good.  Concierge staff member young man, beige suite, fair skinned, glasses, gold glasses I think?maybe black… didn’t catch his name,.. he helped us check in… the lady on reception gave us a room on 7th floor he took us and the the room door was open, getting renovated, no lights worked… luckily he came with our luggage and said no… let’s go back downstairs and had to tell her to…",3.0
"Overall we were quite happy with our stay. In particular the concierge, Mr Hassan, was super helpful as our bags were lost by the airline. He continuously kept us up to date and called the airport twice a day to check on the progress of our bags. The location, however, wasn't ideal for a family trip. The crossroad on which the hotel is located is very congested with traffic and there is limited loading / unloading zones. The tram line is also right in front of the hotel, so it could be a good location for the business traveller.   The rooftop bar was very cool, but the servers were not always available to take orders and help the clientele. The beds are nice and comfortable and the decor is quite up to date.",4.0
We booked this hotel (four women) as we wanted access to a pool and a hamman.  We all enjoyed our treatments - I had a terrific therapist called Imane for my massage.   We also enjoyed chilling out by the pool after a hectic 10 day guided tour of the country.,4.0
"Located in the business center of the city, this could have been perfect.  However, the streets on either side of it were quite busy & noisy.  The rooms were sound-proof so that helped.  It didn't make moving around the vicinity very good because it was a high-traffic area.  Our tour bus could not even stop for very long.  Porters & Front Desk staff were efficient.  The modern decor and the color theme of grey and black would have been something I really like but because the hotel and the rooms were small, the color made it seem even smaller.  The black-grey color theme for the rooms just made them visually and actually cramped.  So, this didn't work for me.  I liked their amenities and toiletries, but the water when showering spilled to the floor.  The room was well-cleaned.  I…",3.0
"OMG  we had the best experience and quality time . Thanks to Mr Kalini and the super beautiful managers Mrs Jalila and Mrs Fatima who always give you the best service,  and on the toproof we have Mr Hassan and staff who are so service wise and hospitality at a high standard . Thanks everyone from Mövenpick we will be back soon ",5.0
Excellent ambience and is beautifully accessorized with art pieces. Spacious rooms with all amenities. Very welcoming staff from checking in to check out and everything in between. Special mention for Pak Deddy at the Banten Bistro for simply excellent service.,5.0
"So let’s start with the pros - such wonderful staff like Meriam at the restaurant, Abrahim the concierge, and Mourini at the reception and generally all the staff and service was great! The menu for lunch and dinner could be improvised- the food was good though! Lastly the rooms, they badly need a renovation!",4.0
Amazing experience. The people are amazing . Hajar and team were exceptional. A place to be when in CASSABLANCA. The food is great. I love everything about the place . We really had an amazing experience. The rooms are also amazing. A place to be DDF,5.0
When you walked around the room in bare feet getting your soles got black from dirt - dust on the curtains and blinds - paint missing all over the place. Dust on the furniture and the drain cover in the shower off and leaning in the corner of the shower. Dark room with weird windows patterned so you could hardly see out.  All of our party - 5 other rooms - experienced  similar. Well below the normal Sofitel experience  we have had the world over.  We are contacting our tour company for a refund and explanation.  The photos posted are by a very good photographer and not representative of the rooms etc.  I should post the picture of the state of the bath mat after my feet had been on it…,1.0

"When you hear the label Sofitel you create great expectative. The hotel is well located but the interior is outdated and not so clean. Pallet of colors and finishes in the room are from at least , 15 years ago. Spa on repair, and a restaurant with exorbitant prices. Ignore why,  but the lobby is full of flies. Maybe the next door hotel, from the same conglomerate, Ibis , is more actual and clean.",3.0
"We chose this hotel for its location and view but was disappointed by the accommodations. The location was indeed ideal being just a short distance from the Medina. The view from our room was stunning and almost distracted us from the things that were lacking from our room.  Unfortunately, though, the room was not clean and some fixtures in the room were broken or missing.  The hotel pool was dotted with missing tile making ruins we saw in Volubilis  better maintained.  Also, the on ceiling plaster was falling into the pool.  The staff was friendly enough but it is sad they were forced to answer for the years of lack of maintenance by their corporate honchos.  Please invest in your properties if you want us to invest our time and money in them.  If the 500 year old riads I stayed in can maintain the intricate tile and wood work, you can re-plaster the ceiling in the pool area.…",2.0
"There's a lot of building work going on around the hotel, making access difficult (not helped by contradictory signage). The lobby and ground floor area is large and has bars, restaurants etc. It was always full of people, mostly business men, I'd guess from the suits.  The spa upstairs was fine but all in need of redecorating (probably as a result of the humidity)  The rooms were spacious and well appointed, if uninspiring. I personally found the windows (covered floor to ceiling in black dots, presumably to keep out sun and prying eyes) somewhat claustrophobic as I couldn't see out easily either. Again the decor was tired - shabby fittings etc. However, when all the power went out in my daughter's room, they fixed it very quickly. All the staff were very smiling, polite and eager to help.  So, all in all…",3.0
"Worst experience ever. I have been there 8th to 11th of September 2022. And my colleagues and I were supposed to stay  until 16th of September for a business trip.  It was my first time In Morocco and we picked sofitel as we know how nice this chain in Dubai is.  AC wasn't working for 3 nights and from the first night we asked when it's gonna be fixed there answer always tonight.  Bed were uncomfortable at all for all of us commented the same, carpets were full of smell of humidity and they were trying to cover it, using some perfumes on the carpet. Was really really bad experience,  we had to check out and moved to other hotel.  The only nice thing there was the staff , they tried the maximum to comfort us but its not their fault, the full building needs a total makeover and…",1.0

"Sofitel is a fine establishment and the staff made my trip pleasant from the time I checked in. My request for an early check-in was accomodated and room upgraded due to the availability of a suite.   Every morning, Hajar and Iman would greet me and make sure that all of my needs were met. They assisted me with knowledge of the surrounding area and city. Concierge even went down to the market to negotiate a suitcase for me because they knew that the prices would be inflated for tourists.   This was a wonderful stay but the staff made the experience worthwhile. I would certainly come back again.",5.0
Rooms and bathroom were not clean and run down. It needs renovation urgently. The bed and the blankets were not dry and the bed was uncomfortable. Staff was nice and helpful. It is definitely not Sofitel quality and standard. ,1.0

The hotel is well kept, clean, tidy and comfortable. The facilities in the hotel are a delivered to a very hight standard. Thoroughly recommended.",5.0
"Good qualities  - friendly staff ( ali , Abraham and Moana )  - location is great  - reception is beautiful   Poor qualities  — the travel desk is unorganized with no prices on tours transfers or information  - they hired us a tour to the market at a ridiculous  price and he ended taking us to a carpet shop ( possible one of his friends ) where he gets commission - wasting a good two hours  - the room fixtures and fitting needs maintenance  - fridge not working  - bathroom floors not that clean   With a little corrections / this hotel can be really nice",3.0
"The food was outstanding, the room comfortable and the spa relaxing. Our room was a bit dated, but the location, food and staff made it a great stay for the start and end of our tour of Morocco. We will certainly stay here on our next trip up the coast, and maybe upgrade to one of the suites.",4.0
"This is a terrible hotel. Staff are not helpful. A pickup from the railway station, booked earlier,  never materialized. We were ostensibly upgraded after waiting for a room for a couple of hours. However, the upgraded executive room was a dump. It required serious refurbishment as the upholstery was dirty and worn out. Likewise, the carpet looked dirty and requires change. The luggage area appeared mouldy.  We were given one soap to share between two separate, but petite, washbasins. The phone did not work and the A/C did not cool. Hence, I had to physically go down to complain -  not once but three times since we could not get any sleep. Repeated promises of sending a technician never materialized. The breakfast was very basic — my daughter had gripes after breakfast probably…",1.0

"Classy, high-end business hotel without being stuffy.  Contemporary design with colorful Moroccan design flourishes.  Quiet hallways with excellent soundproofing/carpeting.  Excellent location in the heart of the City.  Best of all are the staff, in particular the two ""Youssefs"" and the entire crew of attendants at breakfast in the main restaurant.  Attentive (even when busy) and down right playful.  Always enjoyed our interactions prior to starting the day.  See you next time.  Shared our conpliments with the General Manager and the Guest Experience Manager.  -The guys from Washington, DC.",5.0
"My husband I stayed at this hotel at the beginning and end of our 2 weeks in Morocco. We arrived early in the morning and they did everything they could to accommodate us. When we returned at the end of our trip, we spent an evening chatting with several of the staff. Houssam, Adil, Hassan, and Sofian in the Palma Lounge were engaging, professional, and just all around lovely people to get to know. They were congenial and quick with a drink or a suggestion of what to do in the city. 10 out of 10, highly recommend!!",5.0

Next time I will choose to stay in this hotel again. Thanks for everything.",5.0
"Stayed for 48 hours in Casablanca for business, excellent facilities and very friendly staff. Booked the airport transfert through the hotel and it was the best decision ever. The driver was very professional, on time and very helpful; which I appreciated a lot. Food was delicious; Highly recommend Barcelona anfa for going above and beyond to make my trip confortable.",5.0
"The Hotel is nice and comfortable, but calling it 5 starts is a bit much.  I would more agree with 4 stars.   But the main issue is the airport shuttle.  Do not paid for the service, you will paid double than a grand taxi, for something smelly and uncomfortable.   It's so easy to get a taxi from the airport, and to get to it, there is a grand taxi stand just in front of the hotel door!  Don't waist your money, and help the taxi drivers instead.  We have paid 800 MD (80 euros, and way more the advertise on the website) for a service in a car that obviously needed some repair and look nice only in the dark and was very, very smelly (heavy cigarets sent).  Our grand taxi ride from the airport was only 350 MD (35 euros) and was very comfortable.",3.0

After visiting sights in the morning, we spent the afternoon by the pool, enjoying the beautiful sunshine. Staff was very courteous and always available to help. The hotel was a quick 20-minute walk to Hassan II Mosque, which is definitely worth a visit.  Bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. Overall, the hotel was very modern and stylish. If you are spending time in Casablanca, stay at this hotel. You will not regret it!",5.0
"Very nice hotel, big rooms and cleans.  The services are very good at check in, and also in the hotel bar, restaurant and breakfast area. The breakfast was one of the best we have from many others hotels. They care of everything, always ready to help and solve all of our requests.  The minus of this hotel is rooms cleaning service, not because they did not clean but because they always forgot to supply a lot of amenities. We remain or without ear sticks, or slippers, or towel to get out from the shower, or  etc. We will come again and recommend the hotel to our friends.",4.0

"Absolutely gorgeous hotel with top rate service and and insanely comfortable bed.  Breakfast on the rooftop was well worth the price and delicious, and we also enjoyed tapas for dinner.  We would especially recommend the Andalusian octopus.  Finally, although we usually like to explore alone, the front desk arranged a guide and driver for us and it was an incredible experience.

"What a great hotel. Tucked away on a quiet side street. Helpful staff. Large pretty, well appointed clean rooms with large bathrooms. Comfy beds (which we found was a rarity on this trip). The softest most comfy slippers I’ve ever felt. And the rooftop restaurant food is fantastic -  especially at dinner. One of the best meals I had.   My only nitpicks are the beds are too close together especially for such a big room and the draping around the bed is just a dust catcher and unnecessary. Also they should stop putting decorative velvet pillows (which r not cleaned) on the bed touching the bed pillows where guests will be putting their faces. Nothing should be on a hotel bed that hasn’t been washed.   I did have one issue at lunch where a server brought me the wrong dish (I assume because of the language barrier).  Like everywhere in Morocco, smoking is allowed in outdoor restaurants which makes it hard to enjoy your meal. Perhaps one day they will change this.…",5.0
"We had a superb meal in this out-of-the-way hotel in Casablanca. Service was first rate, the food excellently prepared and the cocktails heavenly! Being compact the atmosphere was intimate but by no means cramped and the decor was delightful. Having the roof open added to the special feel of the top floor setting. Highly recommended!",5.0
We stayed one night at Hotel LeDoge and had dinner in the restaurant. We tried many Tapas so we could taste more foods. It was all delicious and we had the best service. We had breakfast the next morning and it was equally good. We will eat at Hotel LeDoge again in the near future.,5.0

"We stayed here for six nights.  The hotel inside is beautiful and the staff are incredibly attentive! The best staff by far of anywhere we have been before. The hotel is a delight of old style opulence and with the amazing staff, it really was a pleasure staying there.  We had the 'standard' room and were more than happy - the maid visited every day and left complimentary bottled water, fruit and nuts.  On arrival we had a complimentary bottle of wine too. We read some other traveller reviews that said this wasnt as good as others in the chain - well those other hotels must be beyond amazing!  We were not disappointed with Hotel le Doge and would definitely return. To add to the hotel and improve guest satisfaction, it would be great to have a local map (for walking) and maybe a list of 'must see' places or some good venues to eat outside of the hotel.  We did ask for a local map but one was not available (due to covid) - Im sure this could have been overcome?  Perhaps a map and list of 'must see' and suggested eating places could be printed on request or another creative way of being provided?  This aside, it did not spoil our holiday or lower our overall view of the staff and hotel.   We loved Casablanca, much more than Marrakesh!  Each to their own, but we felt there was plenty to see and explore here.  However, you do have to be careful when out and about and looking 'lost' - everyone is your 'friend' and willing to help and it invariably involves a cost afterwards! We booked the airport transfer with the hotel and believe that was well worth it - we didnt have to think about how to get to the hotel when we arrived, especially as our flight was delayed.   We also pre-booked through the hotel the Hassan II Mosque tour but was a bit confused to find that this apparently was just a taxi to the place and not an actual booking!  Perhaps this could be made clearer on the website? The roof top terrace restaurant was fantastic and breakfast was amazing!  We also ate in the indoor restaurant.  Again, the decor is lovely. A spa is mentioned but we didnt see it.  I believe there was a complimentary Hamman visit in our booking though this wasnt mentioned when we arrived.…",5.0
We stayed in Casablanca doing one of the legs of our trip to Morocco and had the opportunity to stay at the Le Doge Hotel & Spa.  The hotel is well located near some areas of interest.  We actually walked from the hotel to the Grand Mosque and back one day.  The walk provided the opportunity to get to know the city and see different districts of the city.  It was an experience.  The hotel has this nice stair case that you see in many of of the pictures too.  We also had some drinks on the rooftop deck and had breakfast included with our stay and it was yummy.  The hotel is also part of the Relais et Chateaux.,5.0
"Booked this hotel to have an interesting art deco boutique hotel experience, after having stayed at Riad Fes and the Four Seasons in Marrakech.  Small property in a neighborhood that is hard to find. Front desk service not particularly helpful, made me show proof of free breakfast in our rate three times.  Rooms are a bit tired and in need of updates.  Midnight brought the sound of neighborhood dogs barking and motorcycles outside, heard through closed 3rd floor windows.  The scent of cigarette smoke permeated the hallway air, wafting downwards from the 5th floor terrace where there’s a small bar/resto.  By the way, no hot water in shower despite waiting 10”.    Skip this one and stay elsewhere if you’re expecting a typical luxury boutique hotel experience.  Not a true 5 star…",2.0

I liked the big splashy rooms and lavish baths, the rooftops terrace, the professional staff and the delicious cuisine.  The breakfast on the rooftop was outstanding. My only quibbles were that the hot water was lukewarm and electrical outlets were few. The hotel is well located in a quiet one way street near the Cathedral and the foundation Slaoui Museum. Be forewarned  that the street on which the hotel is located is extremely narrow and very hard to find.  I would stay again at this hotel.",5.0

Breakfast was very nice but dinner was excellent. I had the salmon and my husband had chicken tagine. After11 days in Morocco, having eaten many chicken tagines, theirs was my favorite!  That’s all.",5.0
"This is a lovely hotel that takes you back to the 20's and 30's, located on a somewhat obscure little street in central Casablanca. Rooms are beautifully decorated. The rooftop cafe was great.

"My wife and I stayed at the Le Doge Hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of our Morocco vacation, and 1 night on the way out.  We were very happy with the hotel overall - the beautiful room, the service from Mohammed and other members of the staff, the dining area and bar on the rooftop, and a central but quiet location.  The team there always tried to help with any questions.  We will happily stay there again.

"While Casablanca itself as a city is the least interesting place I visited in Morocco, the Le Casablanca was an oasis in the desert. Excellent, friendly and helpful service across the board. Dramatic lobby gives way to terraces, courtyards and pool. Very good food in the restaurants, again with excellent service. Dinner in their new, fancy restaurant (Pergola) was a nice service and wine experience. But I had chicken tagine thinking it would be excellent given the formality of the restaurant: it was the worst I had on my whole two week trip an; dining companion's French meal was excellent. Next night we had an excellent meal on the terrace restaurant. Overall, I would stay again and stick with the French food.",5.0

The Jasmine Restaurant is very pretty and they have a DJ on the weekends.  We also ate at the other restaurant (forgetting the name) and it was also very good.  A couple of things about this hotel that stood out and would have taken it to another level:  The pool is very nice, but it's almost impossible to get a waiter.  You end up having to go upstairs to the restaurant bar to order and then wait, and wait, and wait for your drinks.  This seems odd, since drinks are a money maker so they're leaving money on the table (and frustrating guests) by not servicing this area.  Also, they put very nice towels on the lounge…",3.0

5* hotel.  Comfortable rooms.  Terrific service. The breakfast bar which is the only choice is ridiculously overpriced $30! The only food during the day is at the bar and it is awful!

The staff were all very courteous, Seddik in the Club Lounge is a gem of a human being, one of the very best staff members I've ever interacted with over the years. Rooms were comfortable, location very convenient especially to visit the Hassan II Mosque. There's a lovely, large pool tucked into the corner of the property.

"I stayed at 4 Seasons Casablanca & at Hyatt, & Clearly Hyatt is Much better, 4 Seasons Hotel is waste of Money with not much friendly staff or a very good Location & more expensive. Hyatt location cannot be any better with the old city & Souq/Medina just across the street, & all kinds of transportation right at the doorstep. Its French Restaurant is also good with reasonable prices.  Room was perfect, very clean & nicely done. The only suggestion I would make is to have Smart TV apps installed in the TV. It gives you a complicated process how to do it with your cell phone I tried several times but could not, if they would directly install Smart TV apps in TV that would be easy.  The hotel is at least 1 hour drive from Airport due to congestion & traffic so keep that in mind…",5.0

This hotel is so well located the stuff are really kind and attentive the food is excellent the rooms are beautiful, the executive lounge is very spoiling and well equipped.

I would like to mention above all the amazing service by two employees: The first is Mr. Rida from the hotel’s Guest Relations department and the other person is Mr. Ossamma from the executive lounge.  They definitely made my stay extra special and took care of every little need that I’ve had, these people makes a difference between just another hotel and a place that has been like your family’s home.",5.0

"We tried to book restaurant Bleu only to be told it was seasonal, you’re in Casablanca, there’s an ocean view from the hotel, surely seafood should be available all year round. Really disappointing.  I did try and book a table via the website, they never replied, which given your reputation & price tag is poor, the communication needs to be improved. Nevertheless we went to the restaurant and it was lovely, the food tasted good, but I’ve had equally as good in far less established eateries with much better value. However, they showed lobster on the menu, only to be told when I was ordering it that it wasn’t available due to the season! Then the logical thing would be to remove it from the menu or tell your clientele that it’s not available prior to giving them the menu. The staff are welcoming and really friendly. Personally based on the menu choices, I wouldn’t return.…",4.0
"Stayed at the four seasons Casablanca for 7 nights and it was truly one of the most luxurious beautiful hotels I’ve visited. Check in was brief and quick, our suite was truly immaculate - comfortable lounge and dining area full floor to ceiling windows with great views and a beautiful terrace - large tv with chromecast allowing you to watch your own devices on the tv. lovely teas and coffee (nespresso) a really nice touch is the Moroccan mint tea and the guide on how to make it in your room. The bathroom was exquisite marble with again floor to ceiling windows - a huge bathtub overlooking the beach and ocean, tv in the mirror and a separate walk in shower. The bedroom was spacious and a large comfortable bed (can choose your type of pillows etc) for the perfect nights sleep. Automatic blackout curtains and a great view of the ocean and pool. Housekeeping was great especially the team in the morning who always made sure you had everything you needed even XL slippers (always find it hard at hotels to find slippers that fit my size 12 feet). Breakfast was superb led by the manager Mohammed Bouhou who honestly does so much for all guests and leads from the front. The fresh orange juice is delicious and for a treat the pain perdu (French toast) is out of this world. Different types of fresh eggs made on request from omelettes to French toast are so delicious. The fresh fruit is so sweet. Pastries / cheeses are also fantastic. Mohammed who runs the restaurants at the hotel went above and beyond for us and is truly a credit to the hotel. A special mention to the team at bleu Salah, redoune, chef khalid and chef adil were always on hand to make whatever was requested of them especially the Moroccan bread and crepes (which Mohammed recommended) with the delicious honey, nutella mixture and the others thank you very much. We also able to have breakfast in bed and honestly it was amazing! The pool area is nice and pretty much the whole pool has sunshine there is also little cabanas which can be used to relax and eat. Salahudin at the pool area was so courteous. The complimentary smoothies, water and sun cream are a lovely touch. The pool water is heated to 28 degrees which on some days felt a bit cold on hotter days it’s fine. There’s also a warmer hot tub connected which is a great temperature and good for kids. The beach which can be accessed via the back of the pool area (key card required)  and security to ensure only hotel guests can come and go. it maybe a public beach but the hotel give you towels etc to use and the beach is lovely (albeit the sea is a bit cold). The food at the pool served by latitude restaurant was delicious and really convenient. We dined at Mint restaurant a few times during our stay and the food was fresh and delicious. Would be great if mint opened and did a lunch or dinner so there was more options to eat. I can’t remember the ladies name who served and looked after us at mint she was amazing. The hotel is also connected to the mall which can be easily accessed via the front gate with your key card and the shops and restaurants are good. A special thank you to Bachir who made our stay beyond luxurious and extra special. We will definitely return to four seasons Casablanca!…",5.0
"My husband and I have stayed at Four Seasons properties all over the world, and have come to expect things you associate with the brand: attention to detail, impeccable service, and fabulous amenities. Sadly, for us, this property misses the mark. The good: check-in was quick, friendly and efficient. The hotel is on the beach and is within walking distance to good restaurants and excellent shopping. Our room was very nice and spacious and clean. That said, there were a few deferred maintenance issues in the bathroom that made it seem a bit rundown. The bad: the property doesn't serve alcohol, and we were told bringing in our own wine was against the rules. This was a bummer as we were there for three days. Also, the food was less than wonderful. For example, on our first night my husband had the lamb tagine and it was tasteless and overcooked and on another day we ordered hummus for a snack and it was likewise tasteless. The pool is nice, but was unattended for service and there were no towels. The service overall was spotty - with some staff very helpful and others bordering on surly. My guess is they are understaffed as well. We chose another hotel for our return to Casablanca several weeks later.…",4.0
"The hotel is beautiful-and they try!  We were on the last day of an Alexander and Robert’s tour.  Everyone had an early flight, we wanted to check in around 4:30 and have a nice dinner before going to the airport at 5 am.  Our tour guide called the hotel 3 times- confirming or arrival. For two weeks this had worked!  When we arrived, keys were ready and handed out with minimum waiting.  It was a small tour-8 rooms.  Upon arrival we found out that a previous group had come and they gave our rooms away.  Four of those rooms already had people in the rooms.  They asked our tour director if we could go to the stadium change, have dinner and the problem would be sorted out after our return from dinner.  After I went to receptionist, finally got my room it took another hour and a half to get my luggage.  I finally went to the luggage room and retrieved my luggage.  Four season prices and Novotel service.  I do believe Four Seasons hotels are way over rated. If you want to be the best and charge for then deliver.  You have not reached that level.  Otherwise, don’t be frustrated and know what service you are getting or not and stay at the Novotel.…",1.0

"Great location on the beach near the Corniche. Direct beach access beside the heated outdoor pool.  Had a superior twin room which was quite spacious and very comfy. No complaints about the room. All amenities top notch.   We had lunch at Mint. Took about 15 minutes to get service. 10 minutes to get beverages and 30 minutes to get food. All were good but quite surprised because there were plenty of staff around and the place was not busy as it was about 145pm. We were waiting in room to be ready.   We got our room at 245pm, 15 mins before check in. They said they would bring our bags to the room although at 330pm I had to call the front desk asking about our bags as I really wanted to go for a swim and unwind. They came promptly after my call.   Had room service that night which was at a pace to be expected.   Room rates had almost doubled in price from our booking in April 2022 to our stay in October 2022. Pleased to have booked early.   The problem with a hotel like the Four Seasons in a foreign country is that hotel could have been in London or NYC as it lacked the character of a traditional Riad or Dar.

"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons here in Casablanca.  The rooms were luxurious and quiet.  The King bed we had was comfortable.  The room size was more than adequate with a sitting area and a desk that was large.  We had a decent sized balcony with an ocean view.  The bathroom was large and ours came with a large tub.

"A good hotel, centrally located in Casablanca. It is a block away from the CTM bus station (which is great, as my next stop was to Chefchaouen direct by bus, since I didn’t want to go to Tangiers first). It is about a half an hour walk from the Hassan II mosque. I am an adventurer, so I very much enjoy walking. I walked through the old Medina and very much enjoyed it (use a map app, as the streets are a literal maze). Gihine at the front desk was fantastic, super helpful, and answered all of my questions. Took off one star because the taxi that the hotel arranged was not waiting for me upon arrival. I had to call the hotel and it seems that no one was ever dispatched. Had to wait over half an hour for him to arrive. The hotel said I could pay the taxi ride at the hotel with credit card, as i did not have local currency yet. I confirmed this the driver. When I arrived at the hotel, the driver kept asking for cash and i told him I don’t have any, I’ll pay inside the hotel by credit card. He said I should go to the currency exchange and he will wait. I said no and proceeded into the hotel. For the hotel, my recommendation (and it’s possible you already have it) is a recommendation of restaurants of different types (for breakfast, for dinner, traditional Moroccan food, etc). I didn’t bother to ask for recommendations as I like to explore and experience. The greatest difficulty I found is the language barrier. Casablanca is very French forward, and not one restaurant I went to had English menus and they had very limited English speaking staff. Had to use a lot of Google translate!…",4.0

The hotel booked an airport transfer for me through an operator they said was excellent, but I had a horrible experience with them. The driver refused to wait for me to get a cart to take my luggage at the airport and the air conditioner didn't work in the car. Would have been better to simply get a taxi. When I provided this feedback, they didn't take any action on it. Very disappointing.",1.0
"The hotel is very clean and comfortable and in a good position.  It has a bar but couldn’t really get drinks. Asked for white wine,none, beers, two left Anything else, no. The breakfast is a bit of a hit and miss in regards to refills on everything including cutlery.  ",4.0
"I stayed here for one night arriving late and leaving after breakfast the next morning. It’s a simple modern hotel with clean rooms, quiet air-conditioning and a pleasant small breakfast room with a simple but adequate breakfast buffet. There is a small bar downstairs where you can get a beer.  All  the staff I came across were very helpful and friendly. Overall a great start to my trip in Morocco",4.0
"We checked in to the hotel at 6.30pm on a Thursday evening - around happy hour according to our tour guide. We tried to order wine or a gin and tonic at the bar - they had run out of both. Resulted in ordering a rum & coke - guess what they ran out of rum! When I enquired whether this was the result of just having opened post COVID 19, I was told no,  they had reopened 18 months ago. Apparently the bar is poorly stocked because they also have a night club and do not want guests to drink too much otherwise they won't go to the club at 10.30pm. We are in our late 50's and early 60's and here as tourists sightseeing - no intention of going anywhere near a nightclub, but would like a chance to have a drink on arrival after a hard days sightseeing!  When we got to our room we found no towels. The reception contacted housekeeping - 15 minutes later still no towels. I went down to reception and requested some priority - no problem. An hour later after a warm beer and half a rum & coke ( the bar ran out of rum as well as gin) I went back to the room and still there were no towels. Another trip to reception and I brought the reception manager up to the room level with me - to find no towels in the housekeeping store. He came back 5 minutes later with two bath towels only, in spite of me telling him there was no bath mat, hand towels or anything else in the room. The excuse I was given was that there were lots of rooms without towels and housekeeping were slowly working their way through them.  I regret the impression I have is of a poorly managed and under resourced hotel!…",2.0
"A comfortable hotel with fabulous staff - they really bent over backwards to help in any way possible.   Our room was clean & comfortable. Laundry service available. Located walking distance to souk, Medina and Hussein II mosque.   Scamwatch! Several people (including us) were approached on the street, day one, by a man purported to be from the hotel. He asks whether you know of the government exhibition of traditional crafts by Berber women, to help support widows and orphans - and promptly takes you to a rug emporium where he earns a hefty commission.",4.0
"This hotel was the starting point for our tour. We stayed for two nights. The room was a reasonable size and the bed was comfortable. The staff were helpful and we felt welcome. It is easy to walk to the medina, the market and the tram line. We used the tram to go to the coast. There is a bar where you can get a cold beer and other drinks. Now for the negatives ~ toiletries are provided in little plastic bottles,   breakfast was a bit limited in choice and there was quite a lot of noise outside at night which disturbed our sleep.",4.0
"This hotel was chosen for us by our tour group and it was a nice surprise.  Centrally located, near several restaurants and within walking distance to the Medina and Hassan II Mosque, it was ideal for walkers.

"I'm so glad that I stumbled across the Odyssee.  Travelling to Casablanca was a last minute decision, and I booked my initial night at the first hotel I came across on Expedia, figuring that I would do more research and find the 'right' hotel for the rest of my visit once I arrived and had time to do more research.  It turns out that no further searching was required.  From the warm welcome I received upon my initial arrival, and the continued excellent service and attention I encountered for the duration of my stay, I felt home at the Odyssee.  The entire staff, from the kind and friendly gentlemen at the front door, to the housekeeping crew and the nice guys that tended the bar, were great.  And the front desk staff were lifesavers, helping me do everything from arrange taxis…",5.0
Very nice rooms with ultra comfortable beds. Ideal hotel if you want to take a break from the city that never sleeps. Ideally located in downtown if you want to discover the heart of Casablanca and very close to all public transportation. The hotel is modern and arty with a Moroccan touch which makes it original compared to the regular four stars hotels in the area.,5.0
"Slept like a princess 👸🏻 in a perfect bed in a perfect tempered room - Breakfast was a healthy refined traditional breakfast accompanied by smiling faces. All the staff is friendly, discreet & caring.  An inspiring boutique hotel full of art & humor. A place that has all the ingredients to make you feel good.",5.0
"While the room and the cleaning staff were nice, the restaurant and its service was terrible. Something a ""4 star hotel"" should never afford. While they have their official opening hours, they work when they feel like it. When we finally managed to find them in the mood to work (outside restaurants are closed due to the holidays) they only offered us 3 options from the whole menu that they could ""prepare"", they also didn't have any soda or juice, just tea or coffee. And what we got was more than obvious heated leftovers combined on a plate. But not only that, we also got food poisoning! Ruined our whole stay in Casablanca!",1.0
Great hotel. Very nicely designed and has modern design and furniture. I slept in it with a group of tourists.  We had a late night flight and were allowed to leave the rooms at 6pm at no extra cost. Truly an extraordinary tribute,4.0
"Hotel was selected for us as part of a package, so we were not sure what to expect. We are very happy with the selection. The location is ideal for walking. The staff was friendly and helpful. The dinner was excellent. The room was clean, modern and well appointed. Special mention to Amine Ghazala who tended bar and provided dinner service. He was gracious, had a great sense of humor and facilitated a wonderful dining experience after a long day of weary travel!",5.0
Stayed here one night with a group tour.  Hotel was very clean and quiet.  Room was very nice (sorry I didn't take pictures).  Window was doubled to keep noise out and I didn't hear anything during the night. Noise from hall can be heard but luckily didn't have any noisy guest. Buffet breakfast was very good.  Would stay here again!!,5.0
"Spent two nights at this hotel in June of 2021. The staff are all extremely friendly and accommodating. Everyone was eager to assist and that made the stay pleasant. The rooms are spacious with dark interiors and somewhat limited amenities, including personal hygiene items like shower caps or lotions. However, housekeeping was timely and did a good job but the room we stayed in had extensive mold (due to the humidity in Casablanca, I would imagine). The location was right in the heart of the ""city center"" and probably well-suited for business travel. It was not an ideal location for vacation travel as the area has a lot of noise and is rather unsightly.",4.0
"Landing in Casablanca for a five week trip in Morocco, we needed someplace clean and comfortable to get over our jet lag. Our room was large and clean, with the requested view of the mosque. An electric tea kettle, a plate of fresh fruit, plus Kitchener all helped make our short stay feel homey. We ate dinner at the hotel cafe our first night - the food was basic and tasty. Breakfast buffet was expansive, with plenty of choices, and fresh omelette. Close to the Hassan II mosque, we found the public space surrounding the mosque clean and family-friendly place. (Be sure to plan for a guided tour of the mosque!) Getting to the medina and other places was a bit of a walk, but good exercise and easy to navigate the streets with Google Maps.",5.0
"We stayed  at Melliber Casablanca Hotel & Apart for 2 nights last month..  I chose this hotel because of it's proximity to Hassan ii Mosque. However, the other main Casablanca attractions are not close. They were either an hour of walking or an hour by bus! ( Yes, some places were quicker by walking than by bus!) There is a bus stop right outside the entrance and a few restaurants in walking distance too. La Cornice, a beachfront disrict with clubs, restaurants & resorts is around 45 minutes walk or £4 taxi ride from the hotel.   Our room was on very big, spacious and had a kitchenette. It was serviced everyday. The staff at the hotel were very kind and helpful. On the first day we had the dinner at their cafe. The cafe menu was very simple and didn't have that many vegetarian options. So we went for pasta and chips. The pasta was very bland but I was hungry and we didn't have any lunch that day, so my plate was polished within minutes!   Their breakfast had variety of hot & cold options. Loved their chilli paste... went well with the Moroccan bread! Also had salad, fruits and yoghurt.   As the taxi approaches the hotel, you get that magical view of the Mosque in all it's glory!…",4.0
"Everything was perfect about this place, its location, the staff, the room, the amenities. This was a 5+ minute walk to the large Hassan II Mosque. You WILL hear the call to prayer, which for us was a great bonus. Plenty of small cafes and restaurants around. You can hear the ocean with the window open. The staff was so welcoming, especially Boubaker. They even upgraded our room for our 30th anniversary celebration and had a swan towel décor in the room. We arrived at noon (5 hours earlier than expected), we messaged ahead to ask if they would hold our luggage, only to find out the room was ready for us already. So amazing. The breakfast buffet crew was also so friendly and efficient. The cleaning staff and doormen also were wonderful. The room was spacious, and had a kitchenette with dishes. We used the refrigerator, teapot and the microwave mostly and all the dishes, so helpful. We had a balcony with a beautiful view of the mosque and the ocean. The décor was modern and well-updated with tile and flooring. I could go on, only good things to say. We would definitely stay here again.…",5.0

"I used to see him during my first arrival to the city from which I will leave after two nights. I liked its location and its proximity to the mosque and the beach. When I arrived, I waited unusually in the entry procedures. The young man, the coffee worker, was nice to me, I waited for someone to help me carry my bags, but no one came, a beautiful room with a view On the mosque and the sea and a fruit plate and an increase of water as I requested, when I wanted to wash the shower head was not fixed and when I finished I informed them and the technician came and promised to fix it, and it was not done! The TV screen is small, and the legs of the room table are unbalanced. the first morning; I came down at 10:30 but the staff were finishing their tasks, so I didn't want to be demanding, from tomorrow I went down at 10, breakfast was not worth going down, Mercy of the smiling cleaner (floor 6) and that friendly bald young man in the cafe and restaurant (who I asked him to bring boxes Moroccan tea for my family) They are the ones whose faces I remember so far!…",3.0
"Overall I loved my stay, but I don’t think it’s for everyone.  I had a balcony overlooking the Mosque and the time I spent sitting on the balcony made it all worthwhile! Such a view that is not possible elsewhere.  The other positives would be the staff friendliness and the bed itself was very comfy and very nice bedding.  The negatives.  The room has a lot of wear- water damage in the bathroom, the shower door doesn’t shut, hot water wasn’t always there, kitchen is ancient.  The staff also did some strange things- my towels would slowly disappear and not be replaced, then one day- no towels at the end of the day.  Elevators are slow.  Walls are pretty thin- not fun to hear the upstairs neighbor cough all day for an entire week.  The breakfast is a bit scary for anyone trying to avoid fruits and veggies (omelette, hard boiled egg, and croissant are what I survived on) or just skip breakfast.  There aren’t many restaurants in the area, no touristy ones, the hotel restaurant can get you by for a snack, I think the food is prepared - decent dessert and quiche.  The location is great if you like to stroll on the waterfront- just one block away- or go sit and watch the families at the mosque, a great thing to do in the evenings.  Taxis are plenty.  I used the Careem ride share app which is great but the taxis are upset about it and some drivers would cancel or make me meet a few blocks away.…",4.0
"I arrived very late - nearly 10PM.   They held the dinner buffet for me.  Room was exceptional.  Large, well furnished, and a spectacular view of the Hussain II Mosque from my balcony.    Bath was a bit small - otherwise no complaints.",5.0
"A well located, well priced option for convenience when in Casablanca for a couple of days. Staff went above & beyond to help in any way they could and breakfast was excellent. Room was spacious and comfy, bathroom was tiny and a little tired. Needs a few upgrades on some of the room fittings and hardly anything in the kitchen area to prepare & cook food, pretty useless in that department. Super close to the Hassan II Mosque, one of the main attractions in the city.",4.0
I stayed here for three nights and was very pleased.  The location was marvelous.  Very clean and well cared for.  Breakfast had a good variety and was very convenient.  The room had every convenience.  I will stay again.,5.0
"The hotel is really nice.  It is a part of a whole complex that includes apartments where people live permanently.  The staff is ever so nice! The food is good.  My apartment was very spacious enough and always at a comfortable temperature with individual controls for each apartment.  Strangely (to me anyway) 'cool' seems to be considered 'cold' here.  The fridge in the room and the cokes served in the bar - dining - smoking area are, at best, cool.  Ironically, the bathroom is tiny. I weigh just over 160, but if I were any heavier I would have trouble turning around in the square shower or getting in/out of the double sliding doors.  CAUTION in the shower... if you turn around or bend over or move too much or are a bit 'fluffy' you can hit the water control lever and get an unpleasant surprise!  I do appreciate having plenty of desk space for my computer.…",5.0

"The main thing I loved about this hotel was how big the room was, it had a large sofa as well as a kitchen area. There was no noise from the outside which was lovely. The shower was very high to reach and I'm only 4ft 11 so I had to hold the shower instead, but I found this was the case in most hotels and riads throughout Morocco.   Staff didn't seem as welcoming as other places in Morocco but that was absolutely fine.  Breakfast was OK but had better in other places.  They didn't have any juice. There was a selection of cakes, breads and eggs available.   Great location and everything was within a 30min walking distance.",4.0
"We are so happy we booked this hotel for our first stop on Morocco. The staff are super friendly, plenty of parking underground and easy to walk to the Hassan mosque and corniche. Rooms are comfortable and a good size, food is fantastic and the breakfast is perfect. Highly recommend staying here.",5.0
This hotel was our first one in Morocco and the location was perfect. Its literally across the street from the Hassan II mosque which is the number one sight to see in Casablanca. We were lucky and had a room on the 7th floor (a suite) with a huge balcony overlooking the mosque and ocean. Its also an easy walk to Rick's bar which is a fun distraction. For a short stay in Casablanca this is a great spot. Food in the restaurant was also excellent and staff were helpful but brush up on your French.,4.0
"The location is great, just a few minutes walk from the Hassan 2 Mosque. Coffee shops and restaurants are just on the other side of the road. The rooms are quite big and comfortable and so are the beds. There is a good buffet breakfast and the staff is very helpful. The place needs a bit of of face lift up, but all in all you get a great return on your investment.",5.0
I love this hotel as it’s just walking distance from the Hassan II Mosque. It’s also good to walk around because there are a lot of cafes surrounding it. The rooms are well cleaned and spacious. My room had a big balcony overlooking the mosque. Definitely coming back when I’m in town.,5.0
"I have stayed here before many times. Excellent welcoming! Great staff in every department. The very rich, fresh, multi diverse breakfast menu is one of the best in Casablanca, including live very friendly chefs standing by to prepare to your choosing! The rooms are extremely nice and very comfortable plus you are steps away from the Eiffel Tower of Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque, the tallest Minaret of Africa, embedded on the Atlantic Ocean.",5.0
"We spent one night at the Melliber Apart Hotel.  The hotel was centrally located and very close to the mosque.  The check-in was quick and efficient.  The staff were kind and pleasant.  A plate of fruits welcomed us in the room which was a nice surprise especially after a long flight.  The room was decent size and we had plenty of space to put our belongings.  The bathroom was fairly basic and the shower was small.  The room was clean and quite large.  We could see part of the mosque from our room.  The room was quiet at night.  Breakfast was good and there was quite a lot offered:  eggs, bread, cereal, fruits, etc.  Some people were smoking in the lobby when we checked out.  We were a bit bothered by the smoke especially since we were traveling with a young child.  If we visit…",4.0
"We only stayed here one night before flying out of the city, but it was a nice hotel. The A/C was great -- very strong and very cool. The location is great, it's super walkable. The room was quite big, which was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast was good, it had several options (and not just bread). It's about a 40 minute drive from the airport. The seal on our shower door was broken so water got all over the bathroom. My main complaint is that the bed and pillows were so comfortable. The bed was just extremely firm and the pillows were barely a pillow at all. Also hard like a rock and had very little fluff in them at all.",4.0
"Kenzi tower is a modern, well situated hotel in Casablanca. However, the service is lacking. Despite multiple requests we never received an extra pillow. The bar manager is rude and unprofessional. We ordered two drinks and after 20 minutes with no drink appearing or any evidence it was being assembled, we canceled our order to attend a scheduled dinner. Forty five minutes later the manager attempted to deliver the now unwanted cocktails. He accused us of lying that we canceled our order despite several others affirming our cancellation. This is horrible behavior by someone in a service industry.",2.0
"Good views and comfortable bed, but the bathroom was dangerously slippery on the floor. There was no milk or tea/coffee making facility in the bedroom and the hotel food was just OK.

The night manager Ibrahim was very rude and didn’t want to assist us he throws the phone on us, when we complained we were not taking seriously and they just let us leave, we forgot our very expensive luggage and they didn’t call us to let us know.

"My husband and I booked the 7 day tour from Casablanca. After our tour we wanted to relax and unwind a bit for 2 nights. We booked the hotel, because there was still a room with a view of the sea free, was really the reason why we chose the hotel. That was probably a handle in the loo, hardly arrived there were already problems, because a credit card was required (2000 Dirham as security if anything should be) where we knew nothing about it, so we also had no credit card with us, with another card it then worked through debit, but otherwise we would probably have had to withdraw the money with expensive fees. Then we were offered a tea, where we then waited in the lounge about 45 minutes! for our room, (we arrived in the evening) to then receive the message that our room with a sea view is not possible, but we get a suite. We then clarified several times that we do not want a suite (the view was terrible), because we want a room with a view of the sea, but was not possible, very disappointing! Then we asked if it would at least be possible for the inconvenience on one day to get breakfast for my husband and I for free, was also not possible, maximum for 1 person. Well, in retrospect, we should rather have booked something else, the staff in general was very friendly and attentive, with the luggage was also always someone helpful to us, otherwise I can not say much, because we were just very disappointed that we did not get the room, why we booked the hotel in the first place.…",2.0

Right after I had my dinner out and got back to the hotel, I wanted to relax and de-stress cause I had quite a long day. First I requested for slippers and extra towels cause I knew instantly that the gap between the shower glass door and the step would cause the water to flood the rest of the bathroom which i totally understand so I thought the quick fix would be to place a bathmat beneath.

They also allowed us to have pool access that day, which was very welcome! It was great to relax by the pool on the shores of the African Atlantic coast! My only gripe, and it's a really minor one, is that there were only a handful of pool chairs, so the first day we were there we had to make do with laying on the nearby lawn (which is very well maintained). I don't know if this has anything to do with us being there during the low season or not.  The room was spacious and clean. There was even a small stove top for those that perhaps would want to cook and stay in.

The one exception was the breakfast lady. She was friendly, warm and excellent language skills. Made the morning.  Also the segmentation looks muddled.

The Service at this hotel is friendly. They assisted us in organizing day trips to Marrakech . The staff's advice and knowledge of Casablanca was much appreciated. Breakfast were good!   The apartment is spacious but furniture is a bit old. The kitchen is large and even has a washing machine and a dryer rack for your clothes. The pool area is very relaxing with loungers on the lawn. The beach is massive  The hotel is in a complex with many cafes and restaurants. One of our favourite was Pauls Cafe and Patisserie. The nearby Anfa shopping centre is also lovely with many shops as well as a Carrefour supermarket.   Wonderful experience and will definitely recommend it,5.0

He did not let me go back to the hotel I was intending to visit. I was so impressed by his welcome that I decided to stay and confirm my reservation. To my delight the hotel is outstanding and it's location not far from the station and the Centre.

Unfortunately, I left personal belongings in the room and 20 minutes after check out, we were calling the hotel to let them know and ask to arrange for the belongings to be sent to me. I finally got through to a kind gentleman who confirmed to me that this was possible. I followed the instructions and emailed their info email address with the list of belongings, my shipping address etc.   I have emailed them 3 times and have not heard anything back, I have also emailed their head of sales and marketing who was visible on their website asking for assistance, and yet no response.   I am very disappointed with their lack of response as it was confirmed by a staff member that it was possible to have my things sent back to me.

Could not get room with two beds  Wait staff in the bar didn't pay attention to customers and took forever to get a drink.    Breakfast was poor at best. Was supposed to be buffet however there were no utensils to dish out the food. When asked, the staff didn't seem to pay attention; just nodded and went along their way.  Ordered coffee three times and never got it",1.0

The bed and pillows were very comfortable and there were blackout curtains - I had the best sleep in our 3 week holiday!  The breakfast was very good although it was difficult for the staff to understand our requests as not a lot of English was spoken. On our first night we had dinner in the International restaurant. It was very good and the service was excellent. On another evening we ate in the Japanese fusion restaurant. Unfortunately, despite being assured that the food was fresh we both were very ill the next day and for many days after that. The only other meals we ate before and after that meal was breakfast at the hotel and I am sure they were fine.  All the staff at the hotel were polite and helpful.

The following day  at i beleive there was man in the blue suit he must of been management beacuse the staff were actually working.,1.0
The hotel staff are very attentive and helpful. The rooms are well appointed and included a coffee maker which we found to be a rarity in Morocco. Lovely wine glasses and a wine/beer shop just around the corner was another advantage as was a full grocery store close by. We utilized the spa services of the hotel which were excellent as was the very warm pool in the spa area. Everything about the hotel including the food was beyond reproach. We highly recommend this establishment.,5.0

We sat at a table and the waiter brought coffee and placed it on the uncleared table in front of us. I asked the water to please clean the table before we used it, which he did, after conveying an expression of bewilderment.

"I stayed at this hotel due to the free accommodation offered by royal air maroc. When I got my room, the doors barely closed, the air conditioning did not work, and there were no towels. I asked for a room change to deal with the air conditioning issue, and they refused and sent me a technician. The technician did not speak english, and told me the machine was working fine when it was spewing warm air at me when set at 16 degrees Celsius. When I again asked for a room change, I was told that ""this is not a good hotel, you only had an economy ticket, it's just a 3 star hotel"". And then I was given a new room and told ""If you have a problem with the new room, we will give you a ticket to go back to the airport to ask Royal Air Maroc for a better Hotel"". Then the new room still did not have working air conditioning, nor did it have towels (at least the doors close properly). I again had to ask them for towels, which arrived after about 10 minutes.  I've been to 3 star hotels in the past and unlike them, this hotel fails at providing even the most basic of amenities and had the least professional staff I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. I've been to youth hostels with better amenities and service than this. If you have any choice at all, avoid lodging here.…",1.0
"In perusing deposit reviews for this hotel, I believe most are not legitimate. Most positive reviews are made by people who have done only one or two reviews. I note that one person was offered a free breakfast to compensate for poor service as long as they provided a positive review.   My story- A significant number of people on my flight missed their connection and we were all directed by Royal Air Maroc to the Relax hotel.   While waiting in the queue, we watched the sole receptionist try to register a guest, while arguing with a client who seem to be trying to get preferential service. To his credit, it looked like the receptionist held his ground. While waiting in queue, several guests already checked in came back to the reception to ask for towels, as their rooms did not have any. For my part, the receptionist checked me in fast and efficiently.  While walking to my room I noted how incredibly dirty the 2nd floor corridor was, with paper and other debris littering the carpeted floor. Walking into my room I noticed that my shoes seem to be sticking to the floor. There was a film of an unknown substance on the floor . I did not walk barefoot on the floor at all during my stay, for it was too dirty. Not to my surprise, my room did not have any towels either. I asked the chambermaid in the hall the next morning for a towel, and she did not have any, indicating that there were no towels. She brought me a towel 20 minutes later.   Breakfast is served on a plastic tray. Continental style with hard-boiled egg, pastries, lunchmeat, cheese, and yogurt. That was fine for me, but there were several other people complaining about the breakfast and their lack of ability to get anything else.   I stopped by the gift shop to see if there were any items that I could purchase as a small souvenir. The shop attendant seemed to spend more time watching me to ensure I didn’t steal anything than offering me assistance.   This would be a far better hotel if hotel management spent as much time giving good service as creating fake reviews.…",2.0

"I've not been having the best luck with hotels in Morocco - my recent experience at Atlas Orient in Oujda brought to mind one of the great questions, who (was rating that wretched place highly in the 21st century)? My experience at Ibis Abdelmoumen brings to mind another, HOW THO? Like how is this one of the best rated hotels in Casablanca and what does this say for the competition? Let's start with getting in. I 'checked in' online and the email I received boldly stated that my cards would be waiting for me at 12pm. Yo Ibis, maybe be a bit more modest in your aims yeah? 20 plus minutes later after an exhausting journey me and my new closest friend in Morocco (judged by time spent together), the front desk clerk are still finishing off some kind of process (I was just standing there). Needless to say, having stayed at hotels around the world this was longer than all other check Ind by an order of magnitude. Not only this, but my new closest friend tried to charge me the whole price of the stay despite me already paying a deposit - et tu, front desk guy?? (Luckily I wasn't so jetlagged to not notice).   At least after such an exhaustive process he endured I got a decent room...oh wait, the toilet was broken and was continuously flushing - which we could hear from the hallway approaching the room. I guess if we'd spent another 20 minutes at the desk they might've caught it.  Also these rooms are noisy bruh (Niagara toilets aside), like for real. We were on the 10th and then 8th floor with the window closed and there were so many car honks that you'd think Morocco had just won the World Cup (they hadn't). If 'urban chaos' sounds like your kind of audioscape get down to Ibis Abdelmoumen - just be sure to calculate in to your stay time to spend at the front desk.…",1.0

This place is conveniently located near the airport, however it is not near any other restaurants, so you are forced to eat at the hotel restaurant. The breakfast was self-serve and fine, but dinner was painful... The staff took forever to come take our order -- we flagged them down three separate times and they kept saying they would come but didn't. When we went to the bar earlier in the night, we had to go find the waitstaff which was all standing behind a wall chatting with each other to ask for service, and they still waited another 5-10 minutes before coming to serve us.

However, if, due to your flight schedule, you check in before 2 p.m., they will charge you an extra 5 Euros per hour even though the room is available and not used by anyone else or awaiting cleaning. My early check in did not give rise to any extra cost for the hotel. This is not how you increase custom. I shall use the slightly more expensive but also better standard Sky Atlas next time. The other issue is with the large number of stray dogs in the area., They do sometimes make a racket, which hampers sleep. No one seems to do anything about this problem.",3.0

Beware of taxis, which charge you Dh 100 for a 2 minute journey, a rip off. The staff were friendly and efficient. The restaurant is OK. It is fairly quiet as it is situated in a trading estate but the stray dogs can wake you with loud barking. The hotel should arrange something with the local authorities to reduce the stray dog menace. For the sake of convenience, I would go there again.",4.0

I think with convenience because it is the closest one ta the airport i would say you have no choice but to book this hotel but when it comes to hospitality and customer service so far they are not doing a good job.

They promised me that they were going to let Expedia know that the refund would be approved. I spoke to the night manager and other manager at the front desk and he assured me not to worry. Of course later on Expedia told me that they had in fact denied the request and went ahead and charged me for three rooms anyway. If that was not bad enough, the hotel itself is disgusting and dangerous and the staff is incredibly rude. They are the only hotel I stayed at in Morocco that enforced the dumb mask requirement no matter where you were. It was more like staying in a prison than…",1.0
"The staff hasn’t improved since our last stay.  Uppity and supercilious.  Front desk man was rude as if he was doing us a favor letting us stay at his hotel.  We have used this hotel in the past for convenience, however, dealing with rude staff isn’t worth the convenience.  This will be our last stay.",1.0
"The hotel is very dirty as for the room there is a bad smell and dirty and I found the side of the bed a nest for a spider in dirty rooms.  Hotel is not for convenience, the breakfast is not bad and the workers there are not very experienced   Not letting your stay in the room",1.0
"This hotel is clearly intended to be a transit hotel, and it fulfills it purpose well. It is located about 8 minutes drive away from the airport in Casablanca. A shuttle arrives at the top of each hour, but allow 10-15 minutes extra to avoid frustration. Pick up is in the general hotel pick up area, but Onomo is not listed on the sign; nevertheless, this is the right place to be.  The hotel itself is relatively new, spartan, and clean. I found my room quite comfortable. Wifi was very good in the room, and there was plenty of hot water in the walk-in shower. Breakfast is not included with the room, but the buffet is available for roughly $9.00 US.   For me, the thing that truly sold me on Onomo, was the front desk. I was having trouble contacting my trekking guide; indeed, my…",4.0
"We started off our Morocco trip with Casablanca and had stayed here one night and will be spending one more at the end of our trip. The rooms are very big with the kitchen inside. The kitchen should make the stay easier for the tourists like me who cooks and eat inside the room. Also, the staff doesn't speak English as their native languages are French and Arabic but we didn't feel any language barrier as the communication wasn't very difficult and they could understand basic English. Location of the hotel is really good. Amazing place!",4.0
"Spent the weekend in Casablanca at the Gray Boutique Hotel. Great experience-friendly and helpful staff. Clean, spacious, with good location.

"Some staff friendly, other staff not so. Room was hot - a/c worked partially. Shower was scalding hot because cold water did not work. Balcony door does not close or lock allowing all street noise to keep me awake all night. No mini bar as described and posted in room. Food in dining room not authentic as claimed. Olives and vegetable out of a can. Chicken tagine horrible.  Rolls served with dinner were warm but hard and stale. Breakfast, eggs taste like powdered eggs, pastries taste like out of supermarket and not freshly made. had to ask for coffee three times before we got served. Staff seem to think it is ok to argue with you, even when you show them what is correct.",1.0
"We were a family of three staying in Suite Hotel Casa Diamond for three nights. It was a perfect stay, nice and clean rooms, excellent food, extremely helpful staff ( a special thanks to Zineb) and had a central position.

This time they upgraded our room for no extra cost and were very helpful in arrangements for our returning home to Norway. We highly recommend this hotel.",5.0
"OUr first night on our Morocco tour we stayed here after flying in and what a pleasant surprise.  Truly 5 star class experience that honestly we never found again elsewhere in Morocco at these prices. The suite was first class with all the amenities and the breakfast was something to behold.  Extensive, diverse and delicious.  Definitely the place to stay in Casblanca.   Also they were great in arranging airline pick-up.",5.0
"Its an oasis in the midst of a busy neighbourhood.  Lots of places within walking distance including some funk restaurants.  The overall comfort, luxury and service level belies the cost.  Best value for money in Casablanca.  The suites are well appointed, spacious and beautiful.  The staff is great and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5.0
"Great hotel, excellent service, nice restaurant, comfortable room, but the roof top bar must be one of the best kept secrets of Casablanca with 360 view around the centre.  I will certainly return if I get the chance.  Note: The hotel has changed its name (according to my taxi driver) from hotel Casa Diamond to Suite Hotel Case Diamond - problem there are 3 other Suite Hotels, so a bit of confusion initially trying to find it.",5.0
The hotel was a choice by my hosts as it was my first time in Casa. I was pleased with their decision. It's in a good area with easy access to the tram. New fantastic hotel. Spotless rooms with all amenities. The breakfast was good and staff were very friendly. My suite was actually large with a separate sitting area and kitchenette. The wifi was exceptionally fast.,4.0

The rooms were nice and spacious with a great kitchenette area.  They have a very nice restaurant as well as a rooftop terrace that we took advantage of and had dinner up there one night. The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked well.  One note on the AC....as this hotel employs energy savings which I applaud, it makes it kind of difficult when you leave your room to keep something charging or keep the AC on for that matter.  So the room was always kind of warm again when I would return.  Not a deal breaker. Also pretty cool....the TV in both the sitting area and bedroom are located inside what looks like a large framed…",5.0

"A true ""western"" hotel in Morocco! Service and rooms are on par with JW Marriotts.  Lovely rooftop area where you can bring your own drinks (no alcohol served on premises).  Rooms are spotless and brand new.  The only thing that could have been improved was the gym - you can get a sweat in if you must, but it's a very small and a bit dated.  The hotel is also a bit outside of the ""main action"" but cabs are available and very affordable.",5.0

No pressure it’s like Somebody is dripping water on me, I do not know it was just my room But everyday I was there it was a struggle to figure out the dang shower, and there’s this god awful design on the bottom of the shower that is very uncomfortable to stand on. As well we asked staff for food recommendations they gave us place 15 minute walking distance that was closed then we came back and he said to eat in they’re restaurant anyways... the food is good there still annoying none the less...

The rooms are beautifully decorated, have a small kitchen, living room, bedroom and a SAFE in the closet. Everything in our room was clean and perfect. (I loved the white and crispy sheets.) There were many amenities in the bathroom along with slippers and robes. The hotel provided complimentary snacks in our room. There was a bowl of fruit, small bowls of nuts, a couple of bags of chips and a refrigerator stocked with soft drinks and waters. A lovely large breakfast is included with that wonderful freshly squeezed orange juice. We wish that every hotel could be like this at such a great price. I wouldn't stay…",5.0
"We stayed for 1 night in the hotel, room was nice but when we checked out we noticed, a 300 euro watch was stolen. We were for 5 days in Casablanca and we went back every single day to complain. The staff didn't take us seriously and only 30 minutes before we had to go home, they showed us 5 mins of the security cam. The housekeeper was very unfriendly and even the management didn't do a lot of effort to help us. I just read another review on here that someone's money got stolen as well. Same period as we were there. Coincidence? Think twice before you stay here.",1.0

"Spent one night at this hotel, which had nice rooms, but the food was pretty bland, and the price of a cup of coffee was something like $6 Cdn. They won't provide bottled water at your meals unless you pay for it, which seems ridiculous in a country where you can not drink the tap water anywhere.",3.0
The staff was superfriendly especially when 40 people are trying to check in at the same time. There were a few gliches along the way. We asked for two twin beds and got 1 king. Had to go back to get a new room. They were very apologetic and gave us a room with two beds. They gave us fresh drinking water and then came to our room to make sure we were happy with the room that we were given. It had a fantastic view of the city as we were very high up. They did everything to ensure we had a comfortable stay.,4.0

Although they help when you come with a car but every time you should park at the second row at the street and give the car keys to the man standing at front.  My room was at the 4th floor facing the main street. There is disturbing traffic noise coming from the road especially the Moroccan drivers love to horn their cars very often. The room walls are very thin; I could hear the man’s snoring from the neighboring room. Maybe this is because of the connecting room setting.…",3.0

His description was like painting on canvas...was already in love with the countryArriving at the hotel and was greeted by Mohamed at the front desk to check in.  His customerservice skills hands down will make me go back just because of him.  His knowledgeof the area and restaurants were spot on.  If you stay in Casablanca you need to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  The staff is measures among the best in the industry.,5.0

It is our second night here (been here just over 24 hours) and we've spent half our time changing rooms and waiting for room keys in that time. We arrived yesterday and sat in reception for one hour waiting for our first room.

Then we found issues with both rooms that they couldn't fix - including blocked sewerage on 7th floor!  Then today they finally changed our rooms to 5th floor to find that one of our new rooms had been smoked in and the AC wasn't working! And the cleaners had failed to report both these things!

But the waiter came around and placed us and as we sat down we mentioned the music was loud. When we sat down we actually noticed the speakers were louder once sat than when standing up. We asked the waiter if it was possible to turn down the volume. The beat to the outside bar was also clashing with the music in the restaurant.  10 minutes went by and nobody was doing anything about it... we asked another time... we had the same polite yes…",4.0

"In the COVID situation, when I'm obliged to book a room for 10 days, no one assist me to do the payment for my room, as it's required a receipt to travel, when I sent my family to pay directly to the hotel as I'm leaving in Dubai, they informed them that you need to do new booking with the double of the original amount which I'm supposed to pay, as their system is not working, to search for your reservation, tried to call 1000 time, no available to take the call, no assistance, it's absolutely not a good hotel, I really don't recommend to go there,",1.0

"A very nice hotel located centrally in Casablanca near the new financial district.  The rooms were spacious, clean and modern.  Friendly staff and nice restaurant.  The only comment would be that any advertising we saw for this hotel said they had a Bar/Lounge with the symbol of a martini glass.  There is no alcohol served in this hotel.  Not a complaint, it is a Muslim country, but should perhaps be clarified is adverts.",4.0
 I would like to inform you that the Onomo hotel workers did not allow me to occupy the room .

"We stayed here at the start of our G Adventures tour. The hotel itself is very nice: comfy rooms with good amenities, nice breakfast, good location. However the best thing about the stay were the extremely helpful staff.

The rooms are on the smaller side but it didn’t matter to us. We could always count on the front desk to answer our calls within 3 minutes. The breakfast was good (included) and the dinner was great (not included). The only negative is that some of the amenities like the gym and laundry room were not available due to COVID. I wish I had known that before I booked the hotel. Other than that, this is an excellent place to stay in Casablanca.",4.0

"During COVID there has been a curfew and it is very difficult to find food after 8pm. Despite arriving later at night from the airport, one of the front desk clerks, Sasouane, insisted that I share some of his food which I think he was saving for his own dinner. That is above and beyond the call and represents the amazing degree of kindness and service you can expect at Campanile. I say that because all the other staff members were just as helpful, whether it came to booking CTM bus tickets when my laptop wasn’t allowing me to, or helping me to arrange for getting a SIM card. Really a kind group just seeking to make sure you have a pleasant stay. Highly recommended, and if you meet Sasouane at the front desk you can tell him you’ve heard of his generosity, I’m sure it will give him a laugh.…",5.0
"Hotel Campanile became our “home from home” after the closure of Morocco’s air space and the lockdown of Morocco because of the Covid-19 epidemic. We stayed in the hotel for seven nights before we were able fly out. The housekeeper (room 1727) was friendly and hardworking. She accommodated us – cleaning our room when we went down for breakfast. Breakfast was basic (freshly baked bread and croissants) and hardboiled eggs, but ample. Breakfast was pre-packed and served on a tray (due to government policy of social distancing guest had to eat in their rooms). The room had tea and coffee making facilities. This made it possible to prepare our own very basic food (“breakfast”-bread, fruit and tomatoes bought at a nearby convenience store). Because of the lockdown we were not able to leave the hotel (except to buy food or medicine) and explore nearby tourist attractions. The staff warned us beforehand that the hotel would close its doors on 31 March. While we stayed at the hotel the number of patrons dwindled – it is therefore understandable that the hotel decided to (temporary) close their doors. A special mention should be made of the kindness and helpfulness of the front desk, especially Abdel Badie, Amine, Jihad and Safouane), as well as the catering staff, and household. We would love to come back to Casablanca post Covid-19 and visit this beautiful city, and say thank you in person for the kindness of the staff of Hotel Campanile.…",5.0

We were going to have a coffee downstairs (there’s a bar off the lobby) but the whole ground floor absolutely stank of cigarette smoke! There were people smoking everywhere throughout our stay.

"Our family of 4 stayed 3 nights at Club Val d'Anfa Hotel.  We have 2 kids, ages 9 and 12, and we were given a room with ample space for all of us.  There was a large king bed and 2 couches that were made into beds for the kids.  There is a pool, and the hotel is right down the street/alley from the public beach, which is a great place to join in a local soccer game but is not a good place to relax for a tan.  The service at the hotel was outstanding and everyone was smiley and helpful.  We had a great time relaxing by the pool with a beer.  For dinner, I recommend going around the corner to Le Basmane for delicious tagine and belly dancers. We ate dinner at the hotel one night and although the food was good, the music was so loud that we felt like we were inside a club.  Overall, Club Val d'Anfa met our needs and we loved the people that worked there, but if I go back to Casablanca, I would choose to stay at one of the beautiful riads in the medina rather than a large hotel with loud evening music (however, of note, we could not hear the music in our room and slept peacefully).  …",3.0

We were able to buy snacks and juice for the room fridge.  Staff here is great (quite a few tho do not speak english) and usually deferred to the english servicer when ordering food. The bar across from the hotel was really great, 1st nite we had tapas and wine, wonderful. If you walk down the path you can cut thru the parking lot and get to the beach.

"First of this hotel is not for families because about 4 o'clock people they come from out side to have a drink in near the pool and the garden. So if you are with family you will not enjoy staying by the pool around that time.

They we cannot give you 1 so if you need hot water we ll get you a glass that's all. Concierge he helped with luggage just when we arrive and always expect you to give them a tip.

I DONT KNOW. ok fair enough I asked about taxi and when again their answer was I dont know how to get taxi!!! Imagine... So the last straw was when I asked to get some assistance with rebooking my transfer as they got my time wrong.  The receptionist said I cannot help you I don't know and I dont know how to use the phone.... Lets get it clear he doesnt know how to use the phone?! I just smiled and wawed what a poor show.

"Fairly new, basic and clean hotel not far from Casa Port station, around the corner from the huge Mogador/Grand Mogador hotel. Very close to a tramway station as well. It shares the building (though not the entrance or the common rooms) with the Kyriad and Campanile which belong to the same hotel company. The area immediately around the hotel is not the prettiest, but nicer areas are within walking distance.  We stayed here for one night and did not regret our choice. Both check-in and check-out were efficient and professional (even though there were some language issues during check-in). We were able to use the free underground car park where a friendly attendant took care of our luggage and delivered it to our room. The room itself was not on the big side, but clean and modern. Same goes for the bathroom. The queen size bed was highly comfortable (as long as you like hard mattresses) and came with very good duvets and pillows (even exceptionally good for this hotel standard). We got a good night’s sleep, apart from someone knocking on our door repeatedly at 5:45am for unknown reasons. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel, but the area where it was served did not look very pretty (quite basic and sterile), so it might be a better idea to use one of the countless cafés which serve decent Moroccan breakfasts.  If you have a short stopover at Casablanca and only need a decent place to stay for a night, this might be a good option for you, especially if you can secure a rate as low as we did (slightly over 30 Euros plus 1,80 Euro local tourist tax).…",4.0

"Only been open a few months so everything is brand new - modern style city centre budget hotel  which is exactly what Casablanca needed. I paid €30 for a room which is great value in Casablanca where there are lots of terrible hotels in this price range. Rooms are small and dont expect a minibar or even telephone in the room! But there is a TV with a few English channels, the wifi and heating works well and those are the most important factors to me.  They serve a continental style self service breakfast which is ok but a bit expensive if not included in your rate, apart from that there is no bar or cafe service at all. However its shares a building with the Campanille Hotel which has a nice bar restaurant and there are a few corner shops nearby for snacks, water etc.  The only negative is that it is a bit out of the main centre, there are a few basic cafes around and otherwise you need to walk towards Casa Voyageurs station (10 mins walk) or take the tram/taxi to the centre for restaurants, sightseeing etc. Tram station is only a couple of mins walk away so not too difficult.…",5.0

There’s a large variety of rooms - singles to four bed rooms, some have terraces and look out onto the lively square below.

My room, up three flights of stairs, was larger than expected with a clean, comfortable bed, lots of storage space, a small desk and even a balcony. The toilet / shower was a bit dated and cramped for space,, but everything was thoroughly clean. A great nights' sleep followed.  Yes, the hotel has seen better days but the current management and staff work had to keep this a clean, quiet, safe property .. and based on all of these factors for me it deserves a high rating.   (More).  I had planned to stay only 2 nights in Casablanca and endedup staying 4 nights. In part this was due to help of the hotel's receptionist. She spoke several languages fluently, recommended a great guide for a day tour, and also made several fun restaurant suggestions. This at a 3-star hotel.  A downside..the coffee shop on property. I walked in one time and decided It was way too smokey for morning coffee. With google maps I found several places with much better coffee/breakfasts within a short walk, including several places inside Gare d Port. Overall, loved the vibe and team at Hotel Central  Exceeded expectations!…",5.0
The location is great but my friend and I are disappointed with our stay. We’re on the third floor in a double room. Things are not that clean and the internet connection is unreliable. The inside of the bathroom door is dirty and there’s a big hole in the ceiling in the hallway. We’re thoroughly unimpressed and happy we’re only staying here for one night. ,2.0
"Staff was friendly, location was good, 8 mins walk to and from Casa Port, which we needed for our airport transfer in the morning. And that's where the positives end. I understand that this in not a luxury hotel, however there's no excuse for the dirty bathroom,  used soap on the sink and the piece of dirty plastic piping in the bed. Literally inside the sheets. I slept with my clothing on.... The room smelled, it was just sad... Spend a little extra and stay somewhere else.",2.0

"I had a wonderful stay at hotel Central. I enjoyed my room, but more importantly I enjoyed the staff. The hotel is sufficient for the price and clean. The location is also great as you can reach to many important spots in the city. With a few touches and fixing this hotel could be one of the hottest spot for budget traveller.   The first day I was welcomed by Sadia who was kind enough to let me choose between three rooms and change my mind in between.   Rachid is the evening and night receptionist. He is one of the most wonderful people I had ever met in Morocco. Rachid would help me to contact my tour guides and make sure I get a taxi to get from one place to the other. I lost my phone in Casablanca and Rachid helped my to search for it and even to buy a new cel. I almost gave up on finding my cel, but Rachid was able to locate it after a lady found it and left it in her hotel. Rachid contacted me in Marrakech and returned my phone back to me. Rachid acted as a protector/advisor to me during my entire stay in Casablanca.  Unlike many individuals Rachid offer his helps for the sake of helping NOT because he is expecting a reward. Rachid is such a kind and honest guy and Hotel Central is lucky to have among their staff.…",4.0
"This is a very small hotel for the student and budget traveller. I liked the close location to the Casa Port train station that takes you to the main station for the airport or other cities. The guy at reception was helpful and assisted with questions and directions. There are local shops and takeaway shops in the vicinity of the hotel. The old medina is also not too far.  The room was very small. There is no fridge or water in the room. There was no gel, soap or shampoo in the bathroom. The Wifi was not working when I arrived and was fixed late into the evening.",3.0

"Good location near Casa Port and walkable to the Medina and Hassan II Mosque  There is a big difference in the rooms, the rooms on the front are bright and airy with some colonial features and views over the square.

"With only one night in Casablanca (already too long in this city..) , the hotel is in a decent location. However it is close to a large industrial port which, along with a lot of street activity, made for a noisy location. The main point though is that it was simply unclean, with hairs on bedding and surfaces not wiped down in the bathroom. I would not stay again.",2.0

The hotel is on the outskirts of the Medina and right in front of the hotel are eateries, coffee shop and banks to get cash. The room itself is pretty tight but spacious enough. The biggest issue at the hotel are the paper thin walls.  You can hear guests throughout the hotel talking and their doors closing.  So, if you are a particularly light sleeper you may have issues with getting a good night's sleep. Overall, the hotel is solid and as expected given the price range.",3.0

"A friend and I,  two women in their early 60's, stayed at Hotel Central on our arrival to Morocco and again, before our departure, four weeks later. Somewhere it says that Hotel Central is in the heart of the medina, in fact it is on the very edge, but, it is a very convenient location. From the airport, we caught the train to Casa Port. From Casa Port, it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel. One of the staff, very kindly, walked me to Casa Port the night of my departure.  The staff was equally helpful in carrying our luggage up and down the stairs for us. The hotel is a great base for exploring that part of the city. We walked to the mosque (take the tour, fabulous!), Rick's Cafe (not worth the time), then a taxi further along the shore. Of course, the medina is right behind the…",3.0
"This hotel will not be anyone's cup of tea, but I LOVED it...  Rooms:   Bare bones, a bed, a table, a chair, a bathroom with hot water in the shower but only cold water in the sink.  If you're really lucky:  A balcony with chair and table overlooking the square in front of the hotel and with sea view.  This might sound less than appealing but I LOVED the room.   I slept 11 hours in the wonderful bed and loved writing on the computer looking over the square.    Heating/ A/C:   There is no A/C but I was here in November and my problem was that the room was getting too cold.  But the hotel DOES HAVE space heaters, so if you have that problem.... ask for one.

Minutes away from Hassan II mosque and walking distance to the tourist area. Located in the medina but right near the edge where it wasn't chaotic.

They offer many choices such as sweet pastries, local breads, slices of meat, eggs, fresh fruits, fresh orange juice,  coffee, and much more.  The  hotel is perfectly located, not far from the tramway and the train station. We did couple day trips to nearby cities such as Rabat (an hour trim ride from here and the trip was very cheap).

I was supposed to be picked up by a taxi arranged by the hostel but we did not manage to find one another a the airport, even though I spent one hour trying to find the driver. Arriving at the hostel (with another taxi), the night portier was pretty dissatisfied that I had not found the taxa driver; and did not give any help as to how the hostel operated (wifi, breakfast etc).

"Lovely place to stay for a fair price. A beautiful villa, very quiet place for those who want to enjoy peaceful time. The yellow room is equipped with proper air conditioning and a very comfortable bed. It lacks a wardrobe and bathroom entrance is via hall,  though it is clearly seen on the photo of the room and in regards of the bathroom entrance is also stated on the website, so all fair and should be no problem. The only thing to put me off was the constant bad smell in the bathroom which required the windows to be opened at all times.  The things to balance it all out and bring the experience to be great was the outside of the villa, which was very beautiful and the outdoor dining area is stunning, with blooming flowers and lots of cosy things around to bring it a unique character. All the staff of the hotel are very nice, polite, welcoming and kind people. The ground floor salon room is done in an amazingly beautiful moroccan style.  The breakfast lady who makes pancakes is very lovely, big thanks to her for those authentic msemen pancakes and moroccan teas which she is truly good at making. The breakfast is also nicely served, good quality authentic moroccan breakfast breads and pancakes, very tender scrambled egg, variety of breads and great muffins. Fresh orange juice, teas and nicely brewed coffee. The rooms are kept decently clean on a daily basis, the garden is well maintained and a kind hard working moroccan gentleman makes sure the flowers inside are freshly cut.  I believe the place will suit you weather you are tourists and plan to have a busy holiday or either if you want to stay for a business trip and work in peace.…",5.0

"The interior is beautiful with lovely kitchen and living space, but overall they were very unfriendly and the construction noise hard to handle so early in the morning. Additionally, I asked for the shuttle service they offered and they said no problem. On the morning before my arrival I messaged to confirm the shuttle would be there and again later in the afternoon, the message was marked as read but no one bothered responding. I arrived at the airport and waited 15 minutes to see if a driver would show but no one was there, so I called the hostel and the gentleman who answered acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about, but 15 minutes later a driver arrived. The driver was very nice and friendly. Subsequently, upon my arrival at the hostel when the gentleman who worked there unlocked the gate it was established that I was supposed to pay the driver direct in Moroccan Dirham, which I did not have. I offered credit card or USD but was told no, they both spoke in a language which I did not understand for 15 minutes while I am just standing there at the gate with no idea what was going on. I had my pack on and had been on a 5+ hour flight plus a 10 hour train with layover in airport so I was exhausted and wanted to get in to drop bags or go to ATM to get driver paid, finally I was told I could enter and paid for my room with credit card and I asked if I could just pay the money to them with credit card since I was paying for room this way and they could pay driver, again he said no. So I paid for the driver the next day when I got cash with tip for inconvenience. (Side note: another guest I met stated the scheduled airport shuttle never showed up to pick her up, so she had to get a taxi anyway.) Now throughout the 2 day stay there, not one employee/owner introduced themselves or spoke to me, although if you needed something, you ask and it was provided. The facility was set up so there was no interaction between guests with breakfast tables set for only one and no greeting from staff throughout. Although, breakfast was nice, with cold pancakes, cereal, fruit, coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. Additionally, the property is surrounded by large construction sites and you are awakened by the sound of jackhammers and bulldozers at 7am in the morning. Thankfully I had only booked 2 nights. Furthermore, upon departure I was in the lobby on the internet for around an hour since I had a little time to waste before I needed to catch the only bus that left to my destination, then when I knew I needed to leave to catch tram to bus station, I handed the gentleman the key to the gate. He proceeds to tell me I have to pay for my stay, I showed him my credit card payment but he did not believe me and would not allow me to leave. Seriously, he kept me locked in when I showed him my credit card payment, ridiculous. Especially considering I booked through Expedia where credit card details are required to book, which if I truly hadn’t paid he could have charged later. Furthermore, if they did not think I had paid wouldn’t they have addressed it the day before, when I handed them cash for taxi driver, the morning of my departure or when I was hanging out for an hour, not when I had to leave to catch my bus? Honestly at this point I was very upset that someone had locked me in to their property when I had made payment upon my arrival, and then he said ‘don’t stress this happens all the time,’ which just made me think that they are completely disorganized, they are unable to keep track of their books and try to charge people double ‘all the time.’ Finally, via phone he confirmed with gentleman who checked me in that I indeed paid. Overall the place is lovely inside, but if you are looking for friendly interaction, peaceful sleep and not to have prove that you paid before they allow you exit, I would say book elsewhere. It definitely does not have a welcoming hostel vibe and another guest stated she asked for help regarding the area and they were unable to provide, just pointing to the map on the wall. Maybe they will get more organized later and realize interaction is good for hostel atmospheres. …",3.0

Good connections nearby, with L'Oasis station a short 10-minute walk away, from where you can take a train and be at the airport in 30 minutes. The beautiful seating area where you can relax with a book and enjoy the sunlight earned me the most comments I've ever had on an Instagram post! And it really is so beautiful, I just sat there and marvelled at the tiles. A good variety of breakfast items, and a nice little outdoors seating area to enjoy the sun and cats.

"We stayed 17 nights there during the Coronavirus Covid-19 lockdown.   The hotel deserves more than 5 stars.  We owe much gratitude to this hotel as we got whatever help we needed from the hotel staff, particularly the young, very friendly and helpful receptionist, Badr.   Badr helped us almost everything, printing permits, emails ….. and even walked us to the taxi rank and talked to the Moroccan taxi driver for us so that we finally got a smooth charter flight out of Morocco.  Bravo, thumbs up and great thanks, Badr.  The hotel room is spotlessly clean and has a great bathroom.  The staff sanitized all areas of the hotel during the lockdown.  The lady janitor cleaned our rooms meticulously so that we felt very safe staying at the hotel.  Thank you very much.  The room is very spacious and its interior design simple but very functional.  We had lots of space to store our belongings and also to walk inside.  That is very important as we could not go out during the lockdown except to get down to the supermarket next to the hotel to buy food.  The hotel enjoys a great location as it is near the train station and has a shopping mall and supermarket next to it.  If not for the lockdown, we could have enjoyed travelling around.  Anyway, we are very grateful that the hotel remained open despite the lockdown and worked laboriously and provided all necessary services for its guests.  The room rate is also very impressive, so we got great value for our money spent there.  Brilliant and outstanding!

The staff were all hospitable and polite - no issues checking in and out.  DISLIKES - the walkway to the room is on sensor basis and at one point the sensor was not functioning well and we were walking in the dark (pitch black kinda dark) until we reached the nearest sensor point which is located at the main corridor door. So, for a traveler who just arrived and didnt know how the sensor worked - it could be pretty scary.

You can’t open a window either because it’s too loud as you are close the train station.

I enjoyed my four night stay at the Al Walid Hotel In Casablanca. I had a relaxing break. The hotel staff was very nice and made me feel welcome.  My room was very clean and comfortable. The Hotel is in a great location just beside Casa/Voyageur Railway station and beside the Tramway as well.  I definitely recommend this place as a good base for visiting Casablanca. There are many nice places to eat and convenience stores nearby which are walking distance.,4.0
"My friend and I stayed in this hotel as part of a tour group.   The bedroom was spacious and they had a really hot shower because it was a cold and wet night when we arrived and I couldn’t wait to jump into the shower.   They also have a good dinner and breakfast buffet of Moroccan flatbreads, croissants, eggs, meats, fruits and much more.  The staff I met were friendly and helpful.   They are also close to the train station which is where we went for our next destination. ",4.0
" Stayed here pre snow Intrepid tour for an extra night. Clean, reasonable size rooms (no mini bar as as advertised but there is a small working fridge and they gave me two small bottles of water) and comfy bed. Breakfast was a little limited but just enough. Still don't believe the waiter who told me that their cappuccino always is half chocolate. Best attribute is that is is right across the square from the Casa Voyageurs train station so you can get into town form the airport for 50 dirhams (about US$5) rather than the $44 I was quoted by the tour company.

We stayed here the first night of a group tour. The room was nice & clean. Perfect size for two people. The bed was comfortable. Lighting was a little on the dim side. The door to our room would not open for us after breakfast when we were in a rush to get to the train with our group. The manager tried & tried to break open the door with no luck. Then he quickly found a mechanic from somewhere who was able to open the door in time for us. So we were very impressed that the problem was solved & we didn't miss our train.,4.0

So many complaints I am not sure where to start.  No working ac. Open the window...uh no. My window opened to an interior smoking room!! Disgusting. Even with window closed I could smell it. The room smelled like dirty feet and the carpet was stained.  The pillows are so huge I couldn't use them bc it hurt my neck.  No safe in the room but had a fridge with a water. Only plus. I would not stay here again.,1.0

The room faced the street and I remember thinking how noisy it would be. To my surprise it was double glazed and I didn’t hear a thing. The shower was a good size with plenty of hot water and good pressure. The air con worked well. Breakfast was typical Moroccan. OJ, boiled eggs, bread, jam and coffee. The good thing about this hotel is that it is across the road from the railway station. My only complaint is that it didn’t have tea / coffee making facilities.",4.0
Started a tour from here.. Heard 100% of the TV in the room across the hall into the evening... past 11pm . AC is managed by the staff - took 2 calls to get it started..  Greeting at the front desk wasn't pleasant.  Can't recommend this place to anyone.,2.0
Stayed here as it was the meeting point for an Intrepid Group tour.  Air Conditioning did not work in majority of the groups rooms.  I let reception know mine didn’t work and they promptly sent someone up to fix it.  There are no safes provided in the rooms. Please keep your valuables with you and do not leave in the room.  I locked my case with my spare credit card hidden inside and it was broken into even though I put the do not disturb sign on the door as I didn’t want my room cleaned just in case as there was no safe available. I am always very careful when travelling and have stayed in many cities and countries around the world and this is the first time this happened to me.  Just wanted to give others the heads up!,1.0
We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights prior to our intrepid trip starting. It is located within 100m of a train and a tram station. We had a room at the front so had quite a decent view of the happenings outside. The only noises outside are the honking of car horns and the call to prayer.  Decent sized twin room.  The only downside was the closure of the shower door - didn’t close 100% (so some water on the floor).,4.0
"Good buffet breakfast, Wi-Fi, In-room TV with English language channel(s), laundry service, located across the square from a train station, plus tram-stop nearby, pharmacy and supermarkets a few minutes walk away.

"We stayed here two nights before starting our Intrepid trip. It was fine. The room was quite big. Bed comfortable. Shower worked well. Staff were very helpful. Near to the train station. We thought the breakfast excellent - quite a range of things to choose from. In fact the breakfast was better here than in many other places. It is a distance from Hassan II mosque which is a must see visit if there is time. I agree with other writers, good to agree taxi prices in advance. That said, one driver who brought us back from the mosque to the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful and went out of his way for us and agreed on a very reasonable price. We tipped him of course. This is a country where such gestures are appreciated. ",3.0
"The double standard room was disappointing, the carpet was not clean, the AC was not working and when the technician came to fix it, the only two options available were either the fan or heating, but no cooling!  No complimentary water bottles, no slippers!  The breakfast was fine and open buffet, but you have to ask for replenishing the serving trays.  The only special thing about Al Walid hotel is it's location right across from the Casa Voyageurs train station.  I paid about 1400 MAD (including tax) for two nights, which is 72 US dollars per night.",2.0

It's easily located by the Casa Port train station (within short walking distance), which is also where we walked to for coffee in the morning.   While there is on-site parking, which you will have to pay for, I don't recommend driving here. We drove in from the airport and found it extremely difficult to get to and to find parking (and we're from a city, so we're used to crazy traffic). There was an event going on at a nearby hotel and it filled every single parking lot and street parking, which forced us to wait over an hour for someone working for the hotel parking lot to be able to take our car.  Overall though, a pleasant experience.",3.0

Second, my television randomly turned on several times during the night. The first morning it occurred around the time of the call to prayer so I thought perhaps someone had set it as an alarm.

I called house keeping, no answer, i called the front desk and said i had no towels in my room, he asked which room i told him he said he would send some up. After 45 minuets on the computer i realized that there was no towel delivery, i call the front desk again. He irritatedly said that he was alone and couldn't leave his spot and that i would have to come down and pick it up. I said why didn't you tell me this in the first place instead of having me waiting 45 minuets when you had no intention of bringing it up to my room. So, ok, i go down for the towel and he hands me 1, one, Uno, single solitary towel. i said can i get another one and he adamantly said NO!. I said what about a hand towel, what about a towel for the bathroom floor, what about in the morning do i have to use the same damp towel from last night??. The long and short is i got one towel, I had it in my mind to use one of the pillows on the bathroom floor after i come out of the shower to teach them a lesson BUT I DID NOT DO SUCH A THING. If the hotel cannot afford to supply the room with at least two towels then how are they going to afford keeping the building looking half way decent. The hotel itself is old dirty and run down, there are large areas of peeling paint at least on my floor. The hotel lobby stair carpet is dirty and thread bare, it cannot take a cleaning otherwise it would fall apart. As for the room it was reasonable enough.

"Don't be fooled by the glamorous photos, it is nothing like that in real life ! I am a seasoned traveller and have stayed in hotels all over the world but I have to say this is the worst, dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in. I had to have our pillows changed because they were disgusting. The bathroom taps in the shower and sink looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the 1940's and there were many drain flies in the shower.  The sink plug was broken and dirty too.  When I did brave the shower, the hot water was tepid at best.  I didn't even want to look at the toilet brush for fear of vomiting.  The smell in the room was so awful I had to buy an air freshener spray in order to try to eliminate the odour. The only positive was the staff who were helpful.  We were offered an upgrade for an extra 15€ per night but the bathtub in the suite was dirtier than the shower in our room so we declined.  Even the maid knocked on my door on the last day to apologise for the state of our room, that's never happened to me before. Breakfast was very limited.  The area the Hotel was in looked like a war zone.  Thank God the Spa was closed, I hate to imagine what that was like or what germs could be lurking there.  Shame I even had to give it a star.

This hotel needs a lot of refurbishment work. It is in serious state of dilapidation for most part. We got a room in the un-refurbished section which was really bad. The room looked super tired and the bathroom looked dirty. But I must say I was very pleased with the shower and it had constant hot water. We stayed for just one night so I didn't complain too much. Location-wise it is good. We went for a late night walk and felt quite safe in the neighbourhood. They offered us free ifthar (breakfast) which was really nice. Dinner was good but had to get to the dishes really fast as they ran out of food within 45 minutes of putting it out. Same  thing happened in the morning. But the breakfast overall was sufficient.,3.0
The registration is on the ground floor and the elevator starts on the 1st floor ... At last at 18:30 we received our key and went up to find the room had not been cleaned!

Unclean, the sheets were visibly dirty, the bathroom had leaks everywhere! The drain in the  shower area    Was gross and the water didn’t drain so you had to shower quickly before the water over flowed! Will not recommend! ",1.0

We were booked in here for the last night of our tour around Morocco and after reading the reviews prior to staying here were worried and as it turned out we should have been.  The Good Nothing.  The Bad - First of all the rooms and hotel smelt of cigarette smoke.  - Second we had to ask a second towel unless we were meant to share 1 towel between the 2 of us.  - Third we went down to the bar for a drink and after about 15 minutes finally found someone to serve us and they took our room number to charge it to. (Note there was only 1 other person in the bar so it wasn't busy.) After that we managed to get a second drink and then decided to go. At this stage we were then stopped and told that we had to sign the account which as fair enough. The problem though was once we did this…,1.0
Just for a night after we land.  It’s convenient location but doesn’t look very safe late at night. I could imagine that it would have been a cool hotel when it was built.

"Disappointing stay.   This hotel was booked as part of a tour we did of Morocco. Having read prior reviews (which were very poor) I raised my concerns with our tour provider who ensured me that they’d never had bad feedback on this hotel.   Unfortunately our experience was similar to that of other travelers.  We entered a musty foyer where the air con was clearly not pumping. We were taken to our room but the key wouldn’t work so we’re asked to sit in a musty area on our floor whilst we waited for assistance.   Once we got into the room, we found the room itself to be spacious, a little dated, and the details were lacking. Cleaning was sub-par with a smear left on the bathroom mirror and surfaces in need of a good clean. Sheets had small marks on them and there were little black insects in the room.   Hair dryer cord had completely perished. Power outlets didn’t work. Only 1 small bottle of water per person and nothing at all in the mini bar which is not good enough in a place where visitors should not drink local water.   I went to reception to get more water, they sent me back to the room to call room service who made me pay on the spot.   We returned to this hotel at the end of our tour and the experience was worse. Took nearly an hour to get into our room. We went out for dinner and when we came back we couldn’t get into our room as the key/entry wasn’t working. It appeared we weren’t the only ones with many disgruntled guests in the foyer for some time with the same issue.   Would strongly recommend people stay elsewhere.…",2.0

"What I saw happinging in this hotel is really ‘du jamais vu’. I have a business in Casablanca but live in Belgium so I visit Casablanca regularly. When I arrived at the hotel I had been traveling for 6 hours.  First of all around 11:30 PM, 2 other guest walk into my room. They were given the same room number as me. I had just arrived after diner and luckily had put everything into the safety box.   Secondly, the lights in the hallway of my bedroom didn’t want to go off. I called the reception and they told to me that they were going to send someone immediately. After 15 minutes I had to go to the reception myself to go and get someone to fix it. I finally could go to sleep at 12:45 AM.  The mini fridge was not filled.  I complained the next morning and the receptionist told me that I could get an upgrade and price reduction from the hotel if I would stay there another night. He confirmed it by whatsapp.   Apparently 2 separate bedrooms does mean a bedroom with 2 beds for Grand Mogador. I declined and they offered me 2 SEPARATE bedrooms (that I demanded and that I got offerend AND confirmed by whatsapp) at full price.  This hotel is a joke. Du jamais vu pour for a 5 star hotel.

"The service provided by the hotel is disappointing, to say the least. The room was spacious, with a balcony where the doors did not close and where you could easily pass to the adjoining balconies, separated by a wall just over a meter high, which immediately made me uncomfortable. One of the face towels they let me was in a deplorable state, as you can see from the photo. Apart from being all tattered, it had a greyish color. The room was carpeted, but the carpet is long overdue for replacement. In the bathroom, the shower stall was badly made, so a stream of water ran out of the base when you showered. The room had a safe, but there were no instructions for use. The service at breakfast was less than sufferable. On the first day, there were no napkins and no orange juice. I had to get the staff's attention,n but it took time for the napkins and juice to appear. I had to go to a plate where the cutlery was piled up to get a fork and a knife, as one of the waiters put it down on one of the tables and never distributed them. On the second day, they put out plates with fruit, orange, and watermelon pieces, but there was nothing to pick them up. I had to get a fork from a table to help myself. There is no coffee. Just a Nescafe machine that serves instant coffee and milk, with lots of added sugar and no possibility to choose not to put sugar.

"Stayed here on a short stop over before heading to Marrakech.  I selected it due to its proximity to the Casa Voyageurs train station which was super convenient.  The rooms were basic and small,however the bed was comfortable and everything was very clean.  The outstanding part of the hotel was the lady at the front desk. She was able to get us into our room early. She gave great directions to all the highlights and even drew us a map.  We really appreciated everything she did to give us such a positive experience.  I recommend this hotel without hesitation. ",5.0
"We stayed at the Ibis Casa Voyageur at the beginning and end of a two week vacation in Morocco. The hotel is super close to the train to the airport as well as the tramway which takes you into the city centre for about $1. We found the hotel to be clean and modern. The breakfast was quite extensive which we appreciated. The rooms were compact but had everything you needed with an excellent shower. They were flexible in allowing us an early check in which was extremely welcome after an overseas flight. The only issue we had was on the last morning we had been told there would be a continental breakfast available from 4 to 6 am which worked well as we had an early flight  and although we double checked with both the restaurant staff and the front desk, when we came down about 515…",4.0

"We requested a car service to pick us up from the airport (cost approximately 400 MAD). Unfortunately, we didn’t see the email stating that the driver was waiting for us at the airport until we were on our way in a taxi. We ended up paying 200 MAD because did in fact make the trip out to the airport. The reception staff felt bad and upgraded us to the “Executive Suite”.   The room was extremely spacious. The room has a balcony and two TVs and sufficient closet space. The toilet is also separate from the shower area which is also helpful! There is also a safe. It's important to note that in our suite, the shower and a sink were located in the bedroom area whereas the half bathroom (toilet and sink) were located in the foyer space before entering the bedroom.  This was helpful when my friend and I were trying to get ready simultaneously.    The hotel is in a good location (near great restaurants, coffee places, shopping and all the ice cream and sweets you want to eat). It’s only about a 10 minute drive away from the gorgeous Hassan II Mosque. The hotel is also a short drive away from Casa-Port Railway Terminal (we took a day trip to Rabat).  Staff was helpful enough.…",4.0

We started our trip at the Down Town Hotel and were so pleased with our stay at the boutique contemporary-styled hotel, that we returned to the location for our last night in Morocco.

Much appreciated!",5.0

"Down Town Hotel by BLH was a great choice for Casablanca, even for just one night.  The location is great, and safe to walk around with many restaurants within walking distance.  The suite was modern, large, spacious, and very comfortable and clean.  The air conditioning and wifi worked well too.  Breakfast was served to the room in the morning and was very good and quite filling.  I think that you also get good value for your money at this hotel.  The only hiccup was that I had arranged for a transfer to the hotel from the airport and received confirmation from the hotel about one and a half months before our stay.  But when we got to the airport, we never found a driver waiting for us.  I had emailed the hotel from the airport but did not get a response, so we took a taxi instead.  The taxi ended up being cheaper that what we would have paid the hotel anyway, so it worked out.  However, I was still disappointed that I never heard back from the hotel regarding the arranged transportation.  Transportation woes aside, the hotel was nice and I would stay here again if visiting Casablanca.…",4.0
"This hotel really ads to your experience in Casablanca, if you are going for business. It's really central, walking distance to the Twin Center, full of restaurants, and stores.  The suites are modern and well decorated. My only complain is that they seem to have been designed by men, for men. There is no full length mirror. Only the one in the bathroom sink. Just a simple  detail, easy to fix, that would add a bit for women....and some men too, I guess.",5.0

A continental breakfast is available, delivered to the room, or can be taken at an adjacent fast food establishment. The free wi-fi worked extremely well, as did the air conditioning.

It's more like serviced apartments with a small reception area and a doorman.  The suite we had was very spacious and comfortable.  It also had a small balcony.  The staff on reception were friendly and helpful and the big guy on the door was a real character, always polite and service with a smile.  Recommended!",5.0
"Actually, one of the best rooms we stayed in! Very cosy, personal and a big suite hotel with nice little balcony. We only stayed here two nights, we loved to stay longer but Casablanca itself has not so much to offer. We also will miss the lady in the reception and the Porter, fixing taxis and luggage. Every time he fixed a taxi for us he silently told us how much it should cost if the driver did not have the meter going. We appreciate that, you take car of your customers!",5.0
"We had a long stopover in Casablanca during our trip, we chose Down Town Hotel for its excellent comments and when we visited it we knew that everything they said was very true.

Everything was perfect, the girls at the reception were very friendly!",5.0

I would like to mention Dunya and Imad here for their outstanding attitude.",4.0
I arrived in Morocco (after a long day of traveling) via Casablanca Airport and I needed a hotel to stay at before I started my travels in Morocco. I could not be happier with my stay as the front desk staff was very helpful and made sure I had everything before I continued on to other cities. I was given an upgrade to a large suite with a balcony and separate sleeping quarters. Superb room and staff! Thanks for a lovely introduction to Morocco!,5.0
This is more like a well-equipped modern and chic serviced apartment with a lift centrally located in a good shopping area.  Both bedroom and sitting room very spacious plus a small balcony with city view.  Room very clean with comfortable king bed.  Both wifi and water pressure great.

"I’ve stayed in this lovely apartment / hotel for six nights. It’s located in Roche Noir, which is part of city centre (Centre Ville), walking distance to the main train station (Casa Voyageurs).  I stayed in a decent size studio apartment, which was equipped with kitchenette. Offering a view of the port. Very comfortable bed and pillow. Very clean, spotless / immaculate in fact when it comes to cleanliness.   The staff have been very friendly and attentive. The reception staff were always there with a smile and genuinely willing to help with any queries you have. In the evening these are security guards standing at the entrance. All staff members are very kind and helpful.  The housekeeping staff stand out as far as I’m concerned: I’ve met Amina and Hicham. Amina is very friendly,  attentive and has strong eye for details.   The property is part of Campanile, I believe French hotel group. Adjacent to it there is a hotel which houses a pleasant bar. Ideal place to spend an hour or two after touring around in Casablanca. The bar offers a wide range of drinks and bar-food. The staff there are equally very friendly and professional. I’ve had the pleasure meeting Mohammed and Hatim, who have been looking after me.  All in all a very pleasant place to stay if you’re in Casa. Highly recommend…",5.0

"I have stayed in five or six other hotels throughout Morocco, including Casablanca and never liked any of them.  So, I was surprised to find this hotel at a reasonable price.  Positives: The facility is very clean and modern. The rooms are spacious, as is the bathroom and the decor is modern chic. The rooms include a small kitchen as well. The staff from the front desk to the cleaning staff are all friendly and amiable. The location is nice as it's a quiet area but within walking distance of attractions and public transit.  The nearest tram station is only a two minute walk.  Both Casa Voyageurs and Casa Port stations are within fifteen minutes walking. There is a Bim mini grocery store next door which is very convenient for getting the essentials and basics. There is a mosque just a few minutes walk away.  Negatives: Not much of anything negative to say about the hotel.  If you're a very light sleeper you'll get some street noise, but it's more like white noise in my opinion.   The central air in the room does not cool down the room much.  However, the rooms' windows do open which is a breath of fresh air.  Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.…",5.0

Another few minutes walk and you are at Casa Voyageurs, a train station with access to the airport and most of Morocco. The hotel is clean and well kept. The staff at the reception desk was friendly and fluent in English. Yusef in particular was helpful with answers to my questions and offers of assistance.

"When I made my reservation at Kyriad Casablanca, I had no idea it would be that nice and clean, as there were not that many reviews about it on line to help make the decision to choose it.  However, Zineb, the best front desk agent in all Casablanca, helped me go for the hotel by simply picking up the phone after the first ring. I know, this must sound strange, as all hotels in the US have that as a training practice but not in Morocco unfortunately. I called many hotels prior to booking Kyriad but none would even pick up, do not know how you can run a hotel without answering phones. I get that most guests book online these days, but still. Anyway, back to Kyriad, I was blown away by how the room is super clean and all the amenities the room had to offer: a small kitchenette with all its equipment and dish ware, amazing bathroom and shower with rain shower head, nice size closet.... About Zineb, (Front Desk), very kind and courteous. Upon my arrival, she had this big smile and complimented me on my makeup and hair. Gave me the top floor upon my request with the amazing Casablanca port ocean view, I sure was a happy camper.   Will definitely go back to Kyriad Casablanca!!…",5.0

Stayed for 1 night with a family. Chose this place as it is a transit point before going to Marrakech.   Location is in the middle of nowhere. Would only recommend if it's for a transit point. Surrounding area seems to be for other offices.  Pros: - Main attraction of the hotel is the price as it is very reasonable - Rooms are quite spacious and modern. Rooms are also clean. - Plenty of parking in the area - Near a Carrefour if you ever need to get some groceries  Cons: - Staff are not as friendly as compared to the rest of Morocco - Very basic room amenities. No kettle or minibar. - Breakfast spread is very basic. Though the staff did not replenish the plates and some food fast enough. We didn't have a plate until 10 mins of eating off the trays.,4.0
"We stayed here prior to flying home from Casablanca Airport. The hotel is located in a business park about a 20 minute drive from the airport. Considering the price, it was very good value. The rooms are somewhat small and spartan, but clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel seems fairly new. We ate at the restaurant in the basement of the hotel and had a good, reasonably priced meal. Being in a business park, I am not sure there are any food options otherwise that do not involve driving somewhere. We did not prebook breakfast but added it for 65 dirhams which was good value.We had breakfast on a Saturday morning and there did not appear to be any egg options with breakfast. I would recommend this hotel for people flying out of Casablanca airport the next day.",4.0
"Functional, clean and very much customer oriented. I liked the cleanliness or the room with small attentions such as the towels folded in a design way and personal stuff carefully set aside. The kitchen staff are very nice and always ready to cook something outside of the normal meal hours to accommodate our business schedule. The reception staff is always asking if the cab they ordered or the places they recommended were pleasant and they also try to find solutions when we have a request out of the ordinary. What I think could be improved is the fact that there is no water (bottle or fountain) available after 11pm, knowing that the use of tap water is not advised. Another thing is that there is no flattering iron in the room and no possibility to use any, as the plugs are…",4.0

"Ibis hotels are not luxurious but very basic. This one is clean, quiet, and decently maintained. After two weeks of riad showers that didn't drain properly, it was nice to take a shower in a stall that drained. Beware that it's about 400 MAD by taxi to the airport if you are a gringo like me. It's nowhere near the downtown/medina but instead is in a business campus. Also, it's a bit hard to find the entrance if you have a driver. Since the campus is gated, I felt very safe even when walking by myself at night on the campus.",4.0

Most important the air conditioner could use some conditioning. Necessary to leave window open. There is a swimming pool and gym but no time to indulge. Restaurant food ok.

"I stayed in Art Palace Suites and Spa from 17 August till 21 August 2022 and was extremely disappointed with my stay and with my experience in this hotel from the first day. I picked the hotel based on some reviews but was shocked to walk into the room which they assigned to me. The only thing that looked exactly like the pictures was the terrace of the room. I booked the deluxe suite but was given a room with a tiny living room that you can hardly walk in. The room had two full bathrooms per the website;; however, the second bathroom in my so called suite was locked and when I asked the reception to open it, I was told that it was out of order because the glass door of the shower was broken. I wondered why did  the hotel sell a room that had a non functioning bathroom? When I complained, they opened the bathroom but warned me against using the shower. The AC was not working and I had to report the issue to the reception 6 times on the first day, with no response. They also told me that I will not be able to sleep before 2:00am because of the live band that plays there since the sound travels to the rooms on first floor. To add the cherry on top, I found a lizard in the bathroom and took a picture of it.I also called the receptionist on duty and showed him the lizard. He talked to someone on the phone and then nothing happened. I guess the lizard must have been a normal scene in this hotel. Do not stay in this hotel if you are used to the minimum standards of hygiene and hospitality.…",1.0
"The room was very nice, but the customer service is not! When we checked-in the front desk said breakfast was included.  When leaving for the day we were in a rush, so we quickly grabbed a croissant before we left and they charged us $20 for bread and coffee. When I mentioned to the front desk that they said it was included and we only got bread they were less than helpful and rude. It’s unfortunate because the place was nice, but customer service terrible.",1.0

"We chose this hotel for its central location, on-site spa (Hamman and massage a must!), and Salma, delightful Reservation Manager.  It did not disappoint!  Rooms are decidedly not Moroccan -- each set in the theme of a particular person of reknown (we were in the ""Michelangelo"" room).   This is fun, and the individualized decor funky.  What was a huge plus, however, was the large sitting room attendant to each room, as well as two full baths -- we were expecting neither.  Salma, in particular, and all the staff are delightful and warm.  If you have never experienced a Moroccan Hamman that's worth a trip to this hotel by itself!",4.0

Then the receptionist kept saying “you should give him (the driver) 350, at least 300”, in a scolding manner. I don’t understand why she interfered if she was unwilling to help with the change.  Then when my husband came back, there was a confusion as who took the remaining money (200).

  Me and my wife spent one night here during our roadtrip through Morocco. The room and the hotel were luxurious and equipped with all conveniences. The hotel had the luxury of a large chain but is small-scale and in a quiet (remote neighborhood).  The buffet breakfast was also very good tasty.

"We had a great stay at the Ocean Park Appart Hotel, it was clean, friendly and comfortable. However there is room for improvement, i.e. the hotel should give a welcome pack to guests upon arrival, such as tea bags, coffee, milk, sugar, biscuits etc? Especially to those guests who arrive after room service hours finish. However we were able to order food to the hotel.  The hotel staff speak English, and accommodate you where needed almost efficiently. You have to let the reception know to get your room cleaned.  The location is good, as it is around 10 minutes car journey to Morocco Mall, which is massive with a food court and around 6/7 minutes car journey to Anfa Place which is a smaller mall with a food court also. The Hassan II Mosque is 20 minutes drive away and the Habbous Quarter and Bab Marrakech Souks are around 30 minutes away. Apparently it is difficult getting a taxi back from Habbous and the taxi guy will suggest a service, however don't pay more than 150 dirhams per hour or tell him to leave you there and hopefully you can flag a taxi back!  The only downfall side for the location is because it is a new hotel, not many people are aware of it, so we were having difficulties with the taxi's to get back, however we explained to them it is near Sindibad and they kind of knew but we guided them as much as we could.  Around the hotel there is land and a few resident apartments, to walk to the beach you will have to go all the way around. Ordering a taxi from the hotel usually costs a few dirhams more as it is ordered from the depo than one you can flag down on the roads.  The breakfast was ok, you had your croissants, toast, cheese, yogurt, fruit, so enough to get you through the day! Also if you request to the waiter/waitress they can make you an omelette (just egg with or without cheese - no onions or peppers) or a scrambled egg. We thoroughly enjoyed the coffee and the orange juice, as well as the moroccan mint tea!  If you order moroccan mint tea after breakfast during the day, there is a charge of 20 dirhams. Also because it is an appart hotel, they don't serve lunch or dinner, maybe they can add in bar snacks so if someone is hungry and doesn't have any ingredients to make anything to eat in their room, they can order a sandwich or fries.  The spa is ok and needs room for improvement in the service to make you feel comfortable and relaxed, we went for a massage which was great. No one asked how you felt afterwards or gave you any drink/water, they didn't make you sit in the relaxation room either, and there were no robes? Also I think it would be better if they had more than 1 massage room and therapists, so you don't have to wait.  Overall the hotel and rooms were clean, which is the main thing. The staff was friendly and it was a pleasant stay.…",4.0

Did they ever! Could not even get an apology for the inconvenience. We also found out that instead of putting an amount for the room and any extras on hold on our card.

When I challenged them on this, the reply I received from the manager was that I had too many cappuccinos.   In short, avoid this disaster of a hotel.

"The room was big and I liked the space. I had a window that allowed me to get fresh air at times when the aircon was too weak. A medium flatscreen TV with English channels was available, which was welcoming. There was a bar fridge in room so that I could keep my water and drinks cold. There is a supermarket close to the hotel for buying water, drinks and groceries. A buffet breakfast was served daily. The Wifi was working fine. Shower gel and shampoo was provided. The location of the hotel is close to the city centre and a 10-minute walk to the Casa De Port train station. The old medina is also not too far away and the reception staff was helpful in providing a map and directions.  You cannot bring guests into your room. The room had no kettle with coffee, or tea and sugar; no water for guests on your arrival. The aircon was not working properly to cool down the room and I could open the window in the evening for cooler air. The buffet breakfast was boring from day 3 onwards, as it was the same food. They were building in the area, so it was noisy at times.…",3.0
"We booked with Intrepid a 13 day trip through Morocco. This started with the briefing and first night at the hotel Les Saisons. We found the room well appointed, very clean and with a lovely set of furniture as well as a big bathroom with a full length bath and shower. The hotel provides good French soap and toiletries and had excellent air conditioning as well as a large TV with several international channels. Breakfast is included and presented very well with a large selection of cold and hot condiments, fresh fruit and Joghurt as well as freshly pressed orange juice.  We were pleasantly surprised by the attentive and friendly staff",5.0
Great location with helpful start  Good place to start your trip into Morocco.  Hotel has all the facilities you need - an even has a bar with ice that you can drink.  Walking distance to the souk and the fantastic mosque which is a must - breathtaking,4.0
GOOD: This is used by Intrepid Travel as a starting point for Morocco tours - Comfort level. The Hotel was OK and uninspiring. Adequate but not sensational. Good thing was the location - pretty OK for Casa!  BAD: Air conditioning did not work. Fridge in room did not work. Bathroom was NOT clean! Included breakfast needed continual prompting to staff for each every item to be replenished. Handing key back I was kept at desk for a huge amount of time even though there were NO extras - like really!!,3.0

"I just returned from an incredible 13 day tour of all of Morocco.  Our tour began in Casablanca and the tour company arranged for us to stay at the Hotel les Saisons the night of the arrival.   The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful.  The hotel seems to be right in the middle of the city but we didn't have much time to explore.  The room was very comfortable with a small but not uncomfortable sized bathroom.  The only meal we had on site was breakfast and while not extravagant, was perfectly fine prior to the start of our trip.  Some others on my group tour said they had arrived a night early and did have a chance to walk around the area a bit.  They said it was close to a lot of sites and the medina.

"We booked this hotel mostly to have a place to leave our bags and be able to shower during a long layover in Casablanca.  While all of the hotel staff wore badges saying that they spoke English, their English was so poor that we were mostly unable to communicate with anyone that worked there.  As an American traveling, I don't expect that everyone speaks English but, don't falsely advertise this by marking it on all of the front desk staff's name tags.  One of the reasons we chose this hotel was that they stated they had an airport shuttle.  When we asked about booking this, the woman working seemed very confused.  She finally said she would confirm it and the cost would be 300 MAD fixed.  When we went down to the lobby to meet the shuttle, the man working behind the front desk…",2.0

I got bitten on all the body but worst part was -  we carried bugs back home our our clothes and suitcase and it turned into an absolute nightmare (it's hard to notice larva as they could be less than 1mm). Bed bugs are very hard to get rid of as they reproduce very quickly and hide well - we thought we got rid of them but after 2 months, they reappeared and I had to call specialists to our home to help spread across the whole flat.  I have previously read some old feedbacks on similar experiences in this riad (on Tripadvisor) but didn't pay quite attention. The hotel should proceed to a complete disinfection (which would take times and is expensive)…",1.0

A beautiful court yard, a big swimming pool, a calm and resort like setting in the middle of nowhere.   We had a exceptional dinner and very nice breakfast.  (Breakfast included in our hotel rate). The turkey tajine  was the best I have ever had.   The place was run by a big family staff.  The owner Mahamond, the host, Latisha, and everyone of the staff was just like a family and welcome you to their home.   The dog, cats, and peacocks added a very nice and welcoming atmosphere.

"Riad Hamdani with all the members of the lovely staff is such a warm, hospitable and fun place to stay. We were treated like friends from beginning till end. The rooms are cosy.  The free shuttle on request to the train station/airport is a great service. The big swimming pool (really refreshing in october) and garden are a nice place to relax. You can have drinks and a good dinner. Mohammed, the owner, is very fun to talk with. All the staff is so kind, professional and caring. Nothing is too much to ask.  The bathroom could do with an upgrade. The shower gives a dated and unclean impression. A little more care for hygiene couldn't hurt. Some rooms need some renovation. There are walking a few peacocks around... (in case you don't like them, like my sister).  The locatian isn't really charming, but convenient to catch a train to Casa. It's a more charming and quieter option than staying in Casa center.  It's the hospitality, personal care, warmth of the people that made our stay here a great experience. Thanks to all the staff!…",5.0
"You would be very hard-pressed to find better hospitality anywhere! From the personal pickup at the airport (and easy communication via WhatsApp), to greeting you with traditional Moroccan tea and cookies, to even making sure that you have a bite to eat after a very late flight, the owners and staff at Riad Hamdani are simply lovely. The rooms were simple and clean, and the shower was very large with great pressure and hot water.   The grounds are well manicured gardens (complete with peacocks!) secluded from the road. Riad Hamdani isn't really near anything (a driver from the riad took us into Casablanca for the day - very helpful! It was about a 30 minute drive) so if you're looking to be closer to the noise and action of Casablanca, this might not be the best fit. But, it's set up so that everything is provided there for you, including towels for swimming or lounging by the pool.  Bonus: food was some of the best we had during our entire time throughout Morocco.   I very much enjoyed my time here and the wonderful conversations I had with the owners and staff.   Tip: bring hair conditioner to Morocco! You can't find it at any hotel or riad! Blow dryers are also hard to come by if you absolutely must have one.…",5.0

"We had been told by more than a few people that we would want to limit our time in Casablanca to one night, so we looked for a place that was close to the airport.  Casablanca was indeed worthy of a one night stand and booking this hotel was definitely the right move.  This is a modest but very accommodating hotel located near but not on the very busy thoroughfare into the city.  Once you pull into their lovely gardens, replete with preening peacocks, a nice pool, and gorgeous plants you will be treated with great hospitality.

They have a garden with three peacocks and blooming herbs and flowers, offer tasty tajines for dinner, and tips for navigating local travel. We will definitely visit again on our next trip back to Morocco. ",5.0
"Riad Hamdani is worse than a dump it should be condemned. Stayed for one night on 2/17/19 in order to catch a morning flight the next day. Biggest mistake! The facilities are in various levels of disrepair, room assigned to us was dirty and smelly. Furniture was crumbling and bed sheets were soiled! Bathroom and toilet were also dirty and the whole setup was awful. We did not complain because we arrived very late and just wanted to rest and get through the night. The manager was very cordial though but that did not make up for the fact that this motel is in a very awful condition. Beyond awful, actually. And the audacity to charge $100+ per night!

I’ve backpacked around Nicaragua/Central America, Cuba etc and stayed in some very humble but appropriately priced hotels.

I brought my family for 3 nights we took 5 rooms !  We got treated very very bad. Including when I refused to pay for food that we didn’t order they threatened to call the police on me, of course I offered to save the call and call the police my self…  They called the CEO and he didn’t care they offered an insulting compensation that didn’t even cover 1% of our damages.

"AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS.  We travelled as an extended family in 3 rooms. One of the rooms was occupied by a female member of the family who was travelling alone.  When she entered the hotel alone one night she was rudely approached and spoken to in an inappropriate, derogatory and simply disgusting, repugnant and disrespectful manner by one of the receptionists who had claimed that he needed to investigate her stay in the room because she had 'been bringing men round' and he needed all of her details and documents including her passport. Nobody had entered her room except her and the only males she had been seen with were her family members who were all staying in the same hotel.  She was so thrown aback that she ran to her room, she did not feel safe to stay in it alone and closed the door and put a chair in front of it as she was genuinely worried that the receptionist (who has a key for every room) would approach her and enter her room without her consent.  After confronting the hotel staff about what had happened, they initially tried to claim it was a misunderstanding and that it never actually happened. In actual fact, the nighttime staff claimed it was routine to check the details of this female who was staying in the room as apparently the room was in her uncle's name. Of course, this was a complete and utter lie given the fact that her entire booking was in her name.  Eventually, the receptionist decided to 'call his manager' but refused to speak to him in front of us, retreating into a hidden room to make secret phone calls. We were given the phone to speak to the 'manager' who apologised profusely and said he would meet us in the morning to discuss the matter further.  We approached the manager in the morning only to find out he had NO IDEA what had happened and we had spoken to someone else trying to cover up the incident.

"We had booked this hotel through ‘Expedia.’  While checking in we were asked to pay a security deposit of 5,000 dirhams. At check out we were told that the money had been refunded. When I checked my credit card statement after a week, the money had been withdrawn and there was no refund. After several phone calls and emails I was told by the revenue manager that we had made another booking for the same dates while checking in. In other words, a double booking for the same dates, and hence the money was with drawn for that reservation!!  An obvious scam and especially at a ‘five star’ hotel !

"The RAM company placed us there for a night transit. This is an old hotel, which has certainly seen its better days. The hotel is full of apology notices for the ongoing works, but I have the impression they were placed there as a pretext to hide the poor status the building is in. The room is OK with a spacious bathroom. Dinner is served late, but the buffet makes it up for the inconveniences of the building, although lots of starch food, but a good salad bar. The service was no different than any Moroccan client out-centered approach, so I had to thank them for allowing me to be a  guest in the hotel.The elevator is broken and being on the 7th floor was no joke.

We then waited till we went down to check out & addressed the issue directly to someone. However, they didn't seem to care that much (maybe this has been happening, and they were aware of it). However, the issue here was the one of our luggages' was placed directly under the AC unit, and part of the belongings in that suitcase were soaked w water. We asked to speak to the manager at the counter, and they said there was no manager on duty at the time (it was 4:15am).

"This hotel does not deserve 4 star according to European standard. Location is not really good. the hotel does not have its own restaurant, you must go to the ""Grand Mogador"" next door. if you don't want to go outside you have a room service with limted choice, but it works. Breakfast is quite modest, not so much variety. Attention is not really exceptional, it's just convenient. Room is OK, large and equipped with basic things, a desk to work, comfortable bed, and good bathroom",3.0
GOOD  Excellent service front reception at check in. Friendly and professional. When I requested a room high up to avoid noise I was immediately allocated what I asked for. Well located  for what I needed - being close to industrial area. Some good places to eat nearby if you want non-hotel food. Money exchange just around the corner. Major train station close by.  NOT SO GOOD  Breakfast choice extremely limited for a hotel of this calibre. Noisy Chinese guests are annoyingly intrusive in dining area and rooms. Some staff do not understand English which can lead to misunderstandings.Bath shower extremely slippery - be very careful.,4.0
"I stayed overnight before a flight home to the US.  The room was large, modern and had all the expected essentials.    The shower worked well.  It did appear that a deep clean on the tile would make things sparkle more.  I may have spotted a little dust in the room too, lol.     The internet was easy to connect to and maintained connection.  The rooms have all the necessary essentials.      There is a restaurant downstairs and a Pizza Hut next door. There is an outdoor market down the road to browse.      The airport is about 1/2 hour away during a low traffic season.      Recommended for an overnight stay.",4.0

Nourddine was especially AMAZING, from check in (we arrived early), to check out, he helped us so much.

"""WARNING NOISY ROOM & POOR SERVICE""   Worst hotel i've stayed in EVER  not even a 2 star hotel. I have booked superior double room but when  I arrived the hotel I have been assigned to a very small single room (RN 1010) rather then the superior room that I have booked.   at night time I could not sleep because the room was very noisy, the fun was making alot of  load noise continuously so i turned it off but the noise was still there even after closing all the windows.  I called the reception and they said they will turn off the airconditioner in my room but they don't do nothing then i call back again the reception and he suggested to move me to a different room I found out again the room has twin separated which i was not happy with it but stayed the night. In the morning i have spoken to the reception again in order to give me superiour double that I have booked for the first place, the reception told me ok we will get back to you but no one get back to me then I went back to the reception the following morning the Same receptionist was there and told me had they not give to you yet? and I said obviously not otherwise I wouldn't be talking to you, after having my breakfast I got back to him this time he told me that there is no room available. I left very upset and went back to my room and ask cleaner if the put the beds together in which she kindly done it for me. Then I wanted for lunch after coming back to my room the key was blocked and no longer working  then went to the reception and ask what happened, this time they said what do you think if you change the room and I said it will be lovely but I want the superior double that I have booked with no noise he said OK then they took me a room on the 6th floor unfortunately it was far Worst then the one I was complaining about it and then I said I have enough now and will stay where I am now.

Not a problem if you are without luggage. But when groups come and go, usually they do have luggage.

Rooms are clean and enough large however there some points that need to improve. The issue I founds are: - The shower head need to replaced - The bidet water pressure was low and directon of the water flow was not comfortable for washing. - Very poor or no internet signal in the room. - Lots of traffic noise from the outside  - There is a time gap between collecting the used towels and dropping the new ones so there is no towel in the room for sometimes. - The bed sheets smell like second hand shop cloths but quite clean, would be better to change the detergent that used for washing the beddings. - The lights of the rooms  could be more brighter. - There was no kettle and cups available in the room to make your own tea or coffee. - The fridge was not on upon arrival and did not get cold enough after turning it on. There was no basic drinks or snacks in the fridge. - The spoken languages are Arabic and French so their ability to help guests with english language is poor and difficult to make communication with staff. - The variaty of breakfast selection could be more. The system of preparing  fried eggs could be improved with a larger fryer rather than using a small fry pan to prevent guest quoue for it, apart from these the quality of food and management of serving guests are excellent. My room service was just including the breakfast therefore am not able to provide any information about the lounch and dinner.

So they practically played us and after 2 days telling us there would be plenty of room and tipping the baggage handler for the kind gesture of showing us the rooms, they just decided to not give us a room because they thought we would beg for a room and offer more money.

"Dodgy neighbor hood, unsecure hotel, expensive, dirty, breakfast does not taste good, the hotel is far away from the towncentre it is really a waste of time. Avoid it simple as that.

"The desk employees were awful. On check-out I was over charged and they refused to give us the finished price. The employee was a teenager, who hardly even knew how to use the credit card machine.   The other employee (who was a bit fatter and black) we had problems with, came to our arguing taxi driver, who was asking for triple the amount that was shown on the meter, and demanded we paid the taxi driver what he wanted. (Ended up calling police and paid the amount on meter screen)  The hotel is very far from anything and you will need to take taxis to get back and forth. It would have been better just to pay a bit extra for one closer to the center and with nicer rooms and staff.",2.0
"Decent enough for a stop over in cosmopolitan and lively Casa. Good shower, clean comfy beds, feels secure. You'll need taxis to get around from here, so make sure they use their metres so you don't get ripped off. The little red 'petit taxis' are good to nip around in and inexpensive. ",3.0
"The rooms are clean, though a bit dark.  It is close (about 2km) away from the Train Station (walkable in the daytime), but fairly dark streets at night.  The front staff gave us a good recommendation for a nearby local restaurant (best pastelle's!) but were not entirely helpful when we were needing a taxi to get across town the next day.  The breakfast was okay.  Had some cut up veggies, porridge (like cream of wheat), breads, cereals, boiled or rubbery scrambled eggs, coffee/tea, and jams.  A bit overpriced for what they offered.  I'd had rather gone to the supermarket a few blocks away and got myself some yogurt and muesli (but we were in a rush).",3.0

Besides, the staff had changed, so the new guy there had no idea how many nights would I stay.   The breakfast is very poor, with old cut vegetables - you could clearly see that they were cut hours before they were served.

The bathroom and shower was very good, although the drains smelt - quite common in Morocco.   I walked to the nearby pizza restaurant / take away for dinner because it was close. My pizza was only average. Other dining options are available within walking distance too and I'd try that next time.   The staff spoke English well enough and were courteous and helpful to me.

"I stayed three nights in the hotel. Two nights for a work-related trip andi extended my stay for one additional night in order to visit the city before flying back.  I must say i don't understand the negative comments, as my experience was really positive - entrance is big and clear - meeting facilities and meeting rooms were really up to standards (and i use approx. once a month hotel conferences facilities) - my room was spotless, super super clan, and th daily cleaning was super efficient.  - staff was kind and helpful... grabbing taxis for me everytime I needed and making sure i would not get overcharged.  They also gave me excellent advices for shopping etc...  On the minus side: it lacks a bit of charm, but it is mostly a business hotel for me, or for people who are not looking forward to staying in an old Ryad (and the hotel never ever pretended to be one)....  I am not convinced by the restaurant of the hotel ... there are better options in Casablanca, but it does the trick. The pool was announcd as closed when i visited.   So, yes, i would recommend the hotel... be it only for the cleaness, the excellent wifi and the kindness of the staff…",4.0

"This hotel purports to be five star but this is a long way from the facts. Apart from the flashy entrance and reception area, the rooms are very tired. I am a tour leader and had a group of ten. Some rooms for two people had no towels and it was difficult to get this rectified without some effort. Rooms for two people had only one cup or drinking glass, plumbing was in a bad state - some baths had no plug, some plugs could not be removed from the bath!! Some gifts did not work. ! Managers seem to be everywhere and there are more suited staff than people actually doing the job. These ‘supervisors’ obviously have never done the jobs they are supervising. The dining room was poorly set up, bowls were hard to find yet supervisors were standing right next to the bowls when they run out. I took 26 minutes for us to get 8 drinks and there was no one else at the bar being served. We also stayed at the Farah Rabat and found exactly the same problems. I asked for five star accommodation and my operator booked these hotels. I will not stay there again and advise my operator to book elsewhere. This maya sound like first world problems but when you ask for and pay for five star, we expect something better than this. Simple riads we used in other towns were far better, with much better service.…",1.0

Initial impression is a beautiful hotel and we enjoyed the welcome tea.  However the fridge didn't work. Essential if you are travelling with a coeliac. The hotel attempted to fix it and were only successful by moving and replacing it with a new one in a different plug. We discovered half the electric plugs didn't work. Dining was a nightmare. The dining manager was rude and abused us for querying whether a dish was gf. He seemed to enjoy shouting at other guests and the poor staff who worked with him.You could hear him shouting and abusing the kitchen staff from the dining room. Not relaxing for dinner. Drink prices were expensive for both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  The safe could easily be carried away.

The second room we had at the end of the trip was much larger than the first room. The outlook onto the street was not spectacular but was interesting. What really brings the hotel down in my rating is that it is in desperate need of renovations. The rooms and bathrooms are old and worn. If you can get into the bath to take a shower you wont have any trouble getting onto a camel, and the exhaust fan was very loud.  The location was OK, close to the tram, shopping and local eateries.

"We stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions as part of our tour . Overall the hotel is adequate and the staff are nice however the hotel is in need of a good clean and revamp.  Both times we stayed our rooms were of a good size with a 'lounge area' and large bed (the second time we had a balcony). Unfortunately the beds in both rooms we stayed in were rock hard and so we did not get good nights sleep at all.    The bathrooms were clean and there was plenty of hot water both times, but the shower is over a bath - which is shorter than the glass wall/door length,  and so it is extremely difficult to step into (more like climb) safely into the bath to have a shower.  our room came with breakfast which we found adequate, and was the usual fare we were to find of  breakfasts offered in Morocco hotels - lots of Breads, pastries, eggs, olives and cheese.

Also it's only a short walk to CTV bus terminal so that worked well for us coming by bus from Essaouira.  They didn’t seem to have our reservation when we arrived but when we showed them the email confirmation we had received they did give us a room.  I suspect we were upgraded as we were given a very large room with a king bed and a very large sitting area. The room was clean, furnishings looked dated to me but that’s not a big problem.

The only complaint I have, and a minor one at that, is that breakfast for us the next day consisted of only croissants and other bread, yet, walking past about 30 minutes later we say others with hot food.

Was stuck in the Elevator for around 2 minutes on the first day! Breakfast was awful.  I called the reception to request water, they told me call the room service then I called the room service and they told me call the reception.

Tried to Iron a shirt but the Iron in the room is damaged and torn out my white shirt  I requested a check out but they denied and said that it is non-refundable and call the agency you booked through. They have not tried to do anything in regards to my complaint.  On 14/10, I had a friend joining for a drink in the bar upstairs and she passed by my room, I received a call from the reception stating that you have one in your room and that it is not allowed and then the security Mr Kamal came and was extremely rude. I went down to the reception to Mr Adel *the receptionist* who was very rude and started shouting to me in the lobby and I requesting to check out and only refunding the drop off to the airport and I will even leave the 2 nights remaining but Mr Adel refused and threatened me and I quote “I will call the police on you as you have someone in your room” and I quote “this lady will not leave the premises and she will spend the night in the police station as well” and he got my passport copy and took a picture with his personal phone which is a huge violation of the privacy of a guest and he stated that “you will spend your night at the police station” I told Mr Adel not to threaten me and he kept threatening me to call the police. I went up and got my  luggage and went for check out and requested the refund for the 350 MAD tomorrow to be done automatically and he said no, you come and we will see. during check-out Mr Adel threatened me again with the videos that I had a guest into my room; not quite sure if is that such a huge offense like I actually killed someone on the premises One of the worst experiences I have ever encountered in my life and Mr Adel is one of the worst people I met in my life in general and not quite sure how works in a hotel! Accor needs to make sure that their staff are trained and know how to deal with a customer even if they are wrong If you are an Arab do not check in this hotel, they are racists and they will only respect you only if you are European.

It is clean and easy to catch taxis etc  However for a family holiday longer than a short stop over I would not recommend   Yes you get separate rooms  But the pool deck was shut when we visited ( we had no advance warning of this)   The breakfast was ok. Omelette station and fresh juice good   Staff were all very nice and we were able to keep our bags there when we went on an overnight excursion,4.0

"We ended up in this hotel due to some misfortunate circumstances so our stay was not planned. Our first impression was good - rooms are well designed, well equipped and the bed quality is on par with Sofitel, and much much better than local Novotel (this was our prime reason to stay in Adagio for long 29 days). Staff is very kind and polite. That’s where the positives end. Now about the rest. The rooms hardly get cleaned. The bed lining and towels get changed daily, and bathroom sink gets cleaned. That’s all you can expect. I am positive that during our stay the room was not vacuum cleaned even once, max i saw happening is wet cleaning of 4 tiles in the very center of the room.

When I explained that the person of the first day told me that the breakfast was included, they had to call the manager/Director of the hotel. The latter was so rude and lucked any sense of professionalism. Instead of admitting the mistake of their staff, rather he had no clients or hospitality skills.

This place is nasty smells badly and just horrible.   I am here right now as I write this review.  On a group tour and cannot believe the tour company chose so poorly.  First and last time here.  I’m checking my documents and if this is where we stay on the return I will just book myself somewhere else.   Let’s start with the filthy bathroom with one tiny towel.  The room is hot and very very musty.  These sheets are itchy and the mattress needs replacing.   The AC is not working and there is no way I’m eating in that dining room - breakfast is included but I will just eat a granola bar I packed in the morning and take a taxi some place for dinner tonight.  Yes it’s that NASTY.  Never traveling with this tour company again.   Did I mention how horrible it was.  Zero stars but the minimum is a one so that’s all they get…,1.0

We checked in and the first room they gave us was dirty and beds not even made. The second room didn’t have toilet paper, soap or shampoo. Very basic room. It was ok for night. The breakfast was not appealing either. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi worked that was about it. Another mom and daughter were in a room across from us and they kept having issues w/their key card and then water was all over the floor- it was crazy. I don’t recommend staying here if you can help it. We were on the 6th floor and were told that the 9th and 10th floors are nicer. This was the view out of our window. It was also very loud street noise.",1.0

The staff in the restaurant were not helpful and we have to wait along time to get a plate or a fork. The light in the room was darky and not comfortable.    I reserved private transportation from the hotel to pick us up from the airport,  we had to wait for almost 45 min for the car (they simply forgot about our request), then when the car arrived we discover it was an old shared taxi and the driver asked us to wait for another 30 min to pick up some other guests with us???!!! moreover, I paid for a private car in full and what I get was not acceptable.…",1.0

My husband and I had a 6 day break here over new year. The hotel was clean but needs a bit of an update. This however I feel is reflected in the price. The staff were wonderful and couldn’t do enough to help. The spa however is a different matter. We had a sauna which I think cost about £10 each. It really wasn’t worth it. There was no steam and the sauna itself had definitely seen better days. I really enjoyed my stay there and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending it for a cheap getaway. ,4.0
"My boyfriend and I had a spa treatment for two: Royal gommage (60 minutes) and massage (30 minutes), for 550 dh each.  We unfortunately did not check the reviews before walking in and were lured in by the fact that they offer hammam for couples.  Despite the price, which is very high for Morocco, the spa is very far from what you would expect in the Western world. The place is very run down, not heated and zero services are offered, they barely hand you a robe (wet and seemingly dirty, by the way). The place is a dump, but we decided to take it as an experience.  The gommage was pleasant and a good experience. After that, we were asked to wait for the massage in a freezing room with our wet robes for more than half an hour. We were freezing, no one attended us. At some point we found one of the workers there and they called us in to have the massage.  The room for the massage was freezing cold and when we said we were cold they first covered us with the cold wet robe and then found a very small blanket, which didn’t do the trick. The massage was poor and the massage therapists were chatting between each other. They used a clearly cheap oil and I came out with mascara spread all over my face- they didn’t help clean it up nor had any product available to do it myself.  As said the gommage was a good experience but extremely overpriced, even for European standards. We came out with a cold, not relaxed at all, with make up spread all over my face mixed with oil and paid 1100 dh- stay away!!…",1.0

Generally ok. Reception was slow but helpful.",3.0
"Chose the domo based off its price and the look of the property. It’s a clean and beautiful hotel with decent amenities. The area is very secure with a 24/7 security guard outside. My room was lovely, it had a separated toilet room from the sink and shower room, it had blinds in the shower so you could see into the room and get some natural light through there. I also quite liked that the bed was a few steps sunken down so it felt separated from the rest of the room. It came with a couch that had a pull out as well as a stove, fridge and microwave. The fridge however was set way too high and froze everything I put in it. Check in was a bit slow and the room I had reserved via Expedia wasn’t fully done in their system so I did have to wait a bit when I first arrived. The one gentlemen who checked me in I just wished had given me a bit more info as I didn’t even know they had a pool till my third day there. The restaurant was also very good, I enjoyed a few meals there. Very nice property I would just say it’s a bit far from the more touristy parts of the city so I did have to hire a car when I wanted to go into town.…",4.0
"My first time in this hotel…. And let me tell you it won’t be my last. I normally hate my stays in Casablanca as it always stresses me out. However, the staff made sure i had a free upgrade to make my stay as pleasant  as possible, Recommended restaurants, gave me directions and tips on how to go to my meetings…. Everything was great. The room was clean, housekeeping was fast with my requests, and free parking always available. Huge thanks to Tarik and Achraf from reception team… you made my stay surprisingly wonderful.",5.0
"The room is nice. Other than that service is crap, food is very poor. I asked the hotel to book a taxi for me to drive me somewhere, and driver dropped me half way. I threatend not to pay  the driver, to force him to drive to my destination, he got violent and started pulling my laptop bag. When later in the day I told the front office staff about the driver they got me, and how he did not take me where I was going, and nealry attacked me. They were completely apathetic.  I have been is crappy places as I travel a lot in the middle-east for business. But at this price for a hotel in Casablanca, and this is the level of service I get.Room safe not working. Shower not working. Electricty activates light automatically in the middle of the night.  I am never setting foot in here again.…",2.0
The hotel is located iff the highway in a business district. There are not many restaurants around and very few open on the weekend. The hotel does not sell alcohol so don’t stay here if that is important to you. The staff spoke very little English and were not very helpful. A card in the room said you must leave a deposit for a pool towel. We went to get towels and they didn’t have any. They said to use the room towels and they would bring us more. They never did and had to call again. We asked the desk to call us a taxi to the airport. The guy ripped us off and left us at the wrong terminal. Rooftop pool is nice with a great view. ,3.0
"Rooms are functional and modern, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. They kitchen is equipped with basic cooking utensils and crockery on request and with a deposit which you get back when checking out. Basic yet is enough to preper and cook decent meals equipt with microwave, kettle and two cooking rings. Carrefour supermarket close by Huge  comfortable bed including memory foam pillows enabling a decent night’s sleep or if you wish to watch some TV then you can do so on a very large screen  from the comfort of your bed or from the comfortable armchairs or sofa.  Shower is separate from the loo which is I believe always a good thing; again large spacious shower and sink makes a comfortable experience with lean towels provided daily, nice hot show with good pressure . Although close to the main road it is fairly quiet, surprising for the amount of traffic that goes by night and day. Gym in the basement is well equipped and spacious and equipment appears to be well maintained, water and towels provided. On the roof there is a charming terrace with a small swimming pool, a bit too cold to swim at this time of year but a great place to chill out and relax, read a good book or watch the world go by from a great height.

"I stayed here for two nights alone waiting for my family to arrive in Casablanca, and I was called to the front desk at least four times to “confirm random details,” but mostly for the man at reception to flirt with me and make small talk. The man (Adil) also called me on the hotel phone multiple times to talk to me past 9 pm, and then somehow looked up my name and added and messaged me on Facebook. This was EXTREMELY unprofessional and made me feel unsafe for the night- I knew they had some sort of master key in the front, and I felt very uncomfortable knowing that a man who was clearly interested in me could access my room at any time. I was also harassed at breakfast. He loitered in my room when I ordered room service, and stopped in the gym several times during my workout to ask me about random details and check me out. These details were unnecessary and obviously just excuses to talk to me. I would not recommend staying at Eurostars if you’re a woman. …",1.0
"Great Hotel. Nothing to say. But far from city center.  Cleaningless was not outstanding. Hairs remained on the floor the whole week.

"My stay with my wife in this hotel was an experience where I found that the Moroccan collaborators of the Toubkal hotel are very human, sensitive people and with an incredible willingness to help people.  My wife had a health problem and needed to be hospitalized, as she was transferred from the hotel ambulance to the hospital, the hotel chairman was present and noted the ambulance plaque, requested the name of the hospital, and thereafter , has given us all the support we need in these difficult times. Mr. Mohammed (General Manager) personally went to the hospital and gave us all the support needed to help us keep track of my wife's state of health, talked to the doctor in charge and informed us of all steps until he was discharged.After returning to the hotel, he offered us all the hotel infrastructure to accommodate us until our repatriation to our destination country at no additional cost, offered us room, food and provided his staff to help us buy clothes and medicine.

Our room was adequate except for exceedingly poor lighting; my other half found shaving difficult and I don't know how women can see to put makeup on! Styling my hair wasn't easy either. Our mattress was old and none too comfy so I slept fitfully. There was no choice at dinner and the chicken soup starter was almost tasteless.

"My wife and I stayed here recently.  It was just what we wanted a small, typically Moroccan style hotel just inside the Medina in Casablanca.   The room was small, but clean with comfortable bed and shower toilet.  The inside bathroom was little wiffy through lack of ventilation and there were few storage facs for clothes so  best suited to a short break of 1-3 nights.  Conveniently situated for Hassan 11 mosque, Ricks cafe and other sights of the medina,  but not noisy.  Lovely roof top patio for breakfast.  Recommended. ",4.0

We don’t like to write bad reviews so we hope that if anyone from Astrid reads this they take it constructively.   Pros: the desk staff did try to be helpful. They seemed friendly although we struggled with communicating.  The desk staff let us cancel our three-night booking after the first night without any charge.   Cons: the bedding was faded and musty. It was hard to tell how clean it was. The shower was dirty. The air conditioning was broken. There was no remote control for the TV. There was no information in the room about the hotel and its services. The beds themselves were uncomfortable and the hotel generally felt unsafe and dirty. There were banging noises throughout the night and the walls were thin. Don’t be fooled by the photos - even the sign outside has completely faded. It felt like the whole place hadn’t been renovated in 30 to 40 years and that there was a skeleton crew running it (and probably not doing any cleaning). We had booked for three nights but checked out after the first night. It was one of the best decisions we made in Casablanca.   There are plenty of other choices at slightly higher prices that are ten times better.   Casablanca is a noisy and chaotic city.

I think they try to keep the rooms moderately clean, but it still felt really unclean and smelled like toxic cleaners. Super outdated. The rooms did not match what we expected on the site or pictures. I would not recommend staying there, even for the price.

I spend three nights in Hotel Astrid. All of them in different rooms. Rooms where good: clean and comfortable. Bathrooms were also very clean but they look used-up and require renovation.   The good thing about this hotel is that reception works 24h so there is no problem when you're coming in the night.  The worst thing is quite noisy elevator (actually the doors) that kept me waking up in the night when some other guests were coming or going. Also the neighbourhood is not quiet (it's the center of Casablanca) so take ear plugs.  The location of Hotel Astrid is very good: it's close to the Place Mohammed V and tramway stop. It is also a short taxi ride from Casa Port railway station where many trains starts or ends. In the neighbourhood of the Hotel there are many places to eat or drink something.

After having showed the reception guy my confirmation email from the UK, he said ""it's not my fault and it's not yours!."" After an hour of arguing he gave us a broken movable bed!  Having sorted the bed problem I thought we will finally have a peaceful sleep-WRONG! The noise from the bar and street was unbelievable and it was going on forever!  The TV does not work and the hotel staff didn't want to fix it.  Take my advice, don't bother staying in this hotel esp if you have kids. It's not for families, business nor tourism! Pay a bit more and stay in a more comfy hotel.",1.0

"After a long day of traveling with a one year old baby, we showed up only to find out that there was no room for us despite having reserved it weeks in advance.  We were sent to a hotel down the street that reeked of cigarettes and we were made to feel as though it was an upgrade.  We also had to pay for our own taxi to the new hotel!!  What a let down, especially for my wife, because JM suites looks really chic and fun.   They didn't offer us anything for the hassle either.  In fact, we had to pay at JM suites and just trust that the new hotel was a real thing.  Now we're sitting in the lounge of this backup hotel smelling cigarettes and steaming mad. ",1.0

"We had used this hotel before and thought highly of it. The second time, the difference was night and day. We were put in a room that smelled so badly of smoke that we asked to change rooms. (We have 2 children.)  They actually had to make sure we didn't use the shower or anything in that room before they would switch our room!!  Instead of bringing the 2nd couch/sleeper like the time before, they put a thin mattress on THE FLOOR for my child to sleep on and thought it was okay. A couple of minor things that could be fixed, so no big deal.  Until night time. The rooms are sandwiched inbetween the sports bar and roof top bar. If you want to sleep here, go somewhere else. It started to get quiet (using term loosely) around 2ish AM!!!",1.0
The best thing about this hotel it is the location in the middle of the city. The restaurante downstairs is amazing and affordable. The bad thing is the noise in the evening as the hotel has a very popular rooftop bar that closes at 1:30 or so. Very good for families without children.,4.0
"I stayed here for 4 weeks on business.  While the room was spacious, it had a bit of an awkward layout (tiny closet blocked by the bed, and an area next to the closet with no door - but a window peering into the shower.  The balcony is too small with no view (admittedly corner rooms were much better than mine).  Several times my room smelled like mildew - it was unbearable - and it seemed to be coming from a sewer backup in the shower or something.  There is only one elevator, it is tiny, and there is only one button for up and down. Unfortunately the stairs are locked at each level, and they do not go to the top floor, so I usually had to wait for the elevator. The staff was nothing but lovely - they tried hard to please my group. The wifi did not work consistently in my room…",3.0

However, one of my ambitions at a hotel is generally too sleep. very difficult at JM with music blasting up from the restaurant, and interspersed with flamenco clapping.

The staff there are great and very nice, but could do nothing to quitene things down, which often went on till close to 1am",2.0
"My rating above does not reflect the hotel quality but my own experience with the staff.   I stayed for two nights. The room was very good in space and had a great balcony overlooking the street. I liked the room, but I didn't like that you hear the noise and loud music from the two bars at the top and bottom of the hotel until mid night.  The hotel location is ideal for tourists.   I didn't try the food, so I recommend that you find other reviews. The bars look good from my short visit, and I've seen many people coming from outside of the hotel to drink and dine there.

Unfortunatley now i have to waste preciuos time to dispute the amount.  I wrote to the hotel to take care of it and so far no response whatsoever.

The hotel bar is connected but a seperate business next door, showing sports and excellent local beer, ""Casablanca"".

For those, who are searching for more “classic” type of hotels in Marocco (with big territory, swimming pool, luxury breakfasts, etc ) this will probably not be the most suitable place.  ",4.0

While trying to sleep i heard was music, laughter from many people and someone walking back and forth until 3 am. The bed felt like on anbox spring and not a regular mattess.

"The name of the hotel made me think of the hotels Kim Kardashian stays in during her holidays. So I was quite excited to be in what I thought would be a nice hotel during my last two days in Morocco, and my first time in Casablanca. The hotel room was pretty, but looks were deceiving. We needed an extra bed as we were 3 people and they provided us with a hospital bed that folded on itself twice overnight, making the person sleeping on it fall to the ground. Breakfast wasn't even included. The frame of the light switch was broken. The bathroom was way too dark, who thought having all black walls would be a good idea? There was rust in the shower head which made it look like the shower head was moldy. I did not want to use it until I realized it wasn't actually mold. The shower doors weren't well designed so the shower actually caused a flood and my room, which was next to the bathroom was wet as well as part of the kitchen. My suitcase was wet. Worst part is that we had told the reception the day before that there was a problem with the plumbing, the water did not go down the drain and it kept rising instead. But nothing was done about it and the next day, the flood happened. Music would play loudly at night. We were also promised by the manager that we would get some money back as compensation, but that never happened. Safe to say it was the worst hotel we had stayed in during our two-week trip to Morocco. It was way too expensive for something this bad. The other reviews were right. Avoid!!!…",2.0
"Overall this hotel was average..The room looked nice but everything in it was poor quality.

You probably do not need anything beside bottle water.    The hotels also has serviced a quite nice breakfast. You can order on the spot as what you like, and they will make it fresh for you.

"Good location if you need to be in Gautier/Racine area of Casablanca  Quality of  service and food is of a two star hotel which is the official rating of the hotel but prices are of 4 star hotel This means that for the same price u can easily benefit from a 4 or 5 star hotel in Casablanca with better service and food. Cleanliness was very average towels old.  Very stingy people despite the high price given its standard. No bottle water offered in the room nor bathroom slippers. We suspect our food poisoning came from their meals.  The new owners mean and unprofessional tried to fraud me many times by inflating the price of my invoice, when I required restaurant receipts to cross check the invoice, they gave me copies of receipts bleury and unreadable but I still spotted signatures that were not mine. When speaking with the personnel I found out she is hated by most of them and doesn’t give them basic human respect and compassion. When disagreed with the invoice, the owner retained all luggages after screaming she is an honest person and claiming she respects the law and order.  I asked to call the police and she refused. She then kept all my luggage on the room after my check out and kept on billing me to inflate the bill more. Again fraud and dishonesty.  Many other breaches with law regarding the way they conduct their business and operate prices. There is a standard of obligations and pricing for a two star hotel. The law is very much regulated in Morocco in tourism because it is an important industry to the country.  This hotel prices as a 4 star hotel but chooses to comply only with 2 star hotel regulations. A way to maximize profit and escape regulations of a higher standard.  Kind of fraud . Again  Anyhow The woman tried to intimidate me and brought the false witnessing of one her assistants to confirm the regulation of price being correct. Luckily I took a picture of the prices declared behind the door of the room and took them to police station then to court.  The police case against the hotel and the new owners is still on and waiting to get my luggage which the owner took after few days to her own office instead of a storage room. I call daily to check on my luggage which includes my important paperwork my kids luggage and personal items. I have been told my am employee that the new owner (woman) stands on my luggage carelessly with rage to damage it.  I have also been told that this is a usual tactic of pulling cash from clients and similar situations happened in the past where the client was forced to come back and pay whatever the hotel requires due to obligation to travel and also the hassle of going through legal claim. I do not recommend this place at all. Very decent hotels with decent prices and good quality are across the street.…",1.0

"Was lucky to be in Casablanca for a week of business. this hotel was recomended by my local ccolleagues, mainly because it was close to our offices in Casa. The first bad surprise was that the hotel did not accept travel agent vouchers. Because of this I had to pay myself. This is the first reason why I wont go back there. The staff is very nice and the bedroom rather big and well equiped with big bathroom. Rather clean even if I foung the previous customer towel hanging behing the bathroom door. ( I suppose the cleaner did not spoted it) However, the place was so noisy!! From the outside (was on the street side) and the inside, people talking in the corridor and in their bedroom bextdoor late in the morning. Definitely not good for a good rest.  Breakfast was OK. I loved, I mean I really loved the fresh orange juice and the pancakes. The bread also was good. The last very bad experience form th eplace was the check out. The machine did not work and did not accept payment by credit card. the receptionist seems to be sorry about that, but it aooears it happends ALSO to some other colleagues a few month before.I had to rush to a cash machine which did not allow me to take enough cash as it was a foreign credit card. Thanks god I had a second one and was able to pay the full amount due. I Because this situation happeens before, I guess the management play the game to avoid credit card payment.

"Went to Casablanca with partner July 2010 for a couple of days from Marrakech by train and stayed in this hotel according to ok reviews from TA. Very disappointed.  From the train station, no petit taxi drivers know where this hotel is. We end up with someone who know the area and spent 10min walking around to locate the hotel. It's not far from the Embassy of Italy and the surrounding looks very safe and well looked after.  Once we got to the hotel, the whole deco looks dull and a bit dated. Front reception staff are friendly enough showing where we are and gave us discount on room rate. They have 3 different types of rooms: standard, club and suite with around 10 dirham difference in price. And the extra money pays you a bath tub in a club and a side table for the suite.  Hotel room is just ok, can be found anywhere in the world with no charactor. A couple of flies were flying above the bed making love circles. Told the reception about it and got a  feeling that why bother. No safe in the room and the bathroom is spacious but plenty of mold around the shower and the bath tub.  Breakfast is not included in the price and costs in between 14 to 30 dirham depending on what you'd like to have. Don't even try it. The cheese sandwich is the worst my partner ever had.  Checked out after one night and headed back to Marrakech.  In all, there are better hotels in Casablanca with similar price range. Then again, why do you want to go to Casablanca?

First thing that hits you as you get off the elevator is the smell of the hallway and the stains on the hallway carpet.  The musty smell intensifies when you open your room door. I asked for the air conditioning to be fixed 3 times and they told me it was.  I'd wake up in a sweat during the night.  Couldn't open the window because of the noise from the traffic. The bathroom flood every time I took a shower no matter how careful I was to pint the shower head to the wall.  Really bad design.  You can tell this happens all the time because the floor and the wall outside the bathroom was deformed by previous water damage. It took me 15 minutes to check out not because there was a line up but because their connection for the credit card machine was not working.  The evening desk…,2.0

"The Hotel Bellerive does not even come close to resembling the description in their internet advertising.  Some of the falsehoods were blamed on Ramadan.  (1).  Their first listed amenity alleges a free buffet breakfast, however it is not a buffet, just four slices of toast (and, after I mentioned a buffet, two hard boiled eggs and later children’s yogurt).  (2).  The second dishonest statement is that the rooms are smoke free.  (3).  The third is that the hotel has a bar, a lounge, a restaurant, a cafe and a deli. Only coffee and soft drinks are available during Ramadan.  (4).  Another falsehood is that there is a 24 Hour front desk as the doors are locked at midnight and you have to try to wake the night guy.  (5). Skipping the toast breakfast, I slept in until noon and missed out on the so called “daily” housekeeping and they only cleaned the room once during my week.  (6). The rooms do not have queen beds as listed; two broken frame single beds.  (7).  The listed satellite tv probably is not satellite as it has just 13 channels, none in English.  Upon arrival, the room was full of mosquitos.  They got rid of some of them.  There was used silverware and other items under the beds.…",1.0

We looked at it but the shutters were broken so we could not get out on to the balcony. He said that was all he had. Consequently we looked at some other hotels nearby and moved out.  Barely adequate is how I would describe the room. Not much for your money. The concierge was unhelpful and unwilling. He didn't even seem bothered when we moved out.

(They didn't fix it) I had to withdraw cash from a euro card with a huge percentage (and in Casablanca, not all ATMs work with our cards, plus it’s dangerous to walk around the street with money, I was lucky that I had “help” from local ones).

"Having seen the reviews and photos from previously, I can say this was based on the old interior design and it looks to me a lot has changed. I'm also guessing the staff has changed as we had a lovely host on reception.  We only stayed one night in mid August. We were told of paying a slightly higher rate than what I had reserved. I mentioned it to the man on reception who without hesiatation, rang management and gave us the room at the rate I had seen originally. We were offered a room with a double and single bed or the one I had reserved - 3 single beds. We chose the latter as we just liked it better, after they kindly offered to show us both. There was a balcony which was a bonus. The room came with a mini fridge and I think a safe too. Complimentary toiletries were provided too. However the telephone didn't work and the room needed more USB ports/electrical switches. We weren't provided slippers as shown on their photos.  It was a buffet breakfast and therefore plenty of choices. The staff there were polite and friendly. The hotel is opposite a supermarket which is very useful.

When I got there I found a guy in reception and at first, he didn't know what I was talking about when I told him I have an online reservation. The hotel did not look anything near what the photos showed on booking.com. It was dirty and it was in the remodeling process. There was construction debris everywhere. and rooms smelt like paint. I had to find another place to stay. I didnt get my refund through booking.com. When I tried to leave a review on booking.com they wouldn't let me. It was a very bad experience, avoid this hotel!",1.0
"The hotel is nicely located and not far from the train station. I had a pleasent stay and the staff was friendly.  Once back home, I noticed that they had deducted 1 night (from the 5) from my creditcard while I paid in cash at the reception.  The hotel does not respond on email over this or on any other matter. By calling, I finanlly received the managers WhatsApp number and started a communication with him conerning the issue. The manager promissed to settle the matter and for a while we were chatting in a friendly way. Only to find out that it was probably only a strategy to exceed the term in which I could ask the credit card company to rewind the payment. Credit card companies require a communication with the service provider first, but if that service provider takes his time with empty promisses, you are then too late to get your money back.…",1.0

"My partner needed to catch an early plane from Casablanca - Mohammed V Airport so we though it would be wise to stay in Casablanca overnight instead of having to travel from Marrakech in the morning. On arrival at the taxi rank at the train Station, the taxi driver when we told him where we were going, immediately got on the phone to the hotel informing them we were coming. He then asked us what our nationalities were before stepping aside to have a further three or so minutes of conversation with the hotel staff, presumably the owner (he actually asked if we were a certain nationality which we are not). He then took us there but made a point to in with us and tell the hotel owner that we were the customers he called about. The elderly man at reception who spoke little or no English was quite rude in the way he dealt with us. When we were registered he refused to give us our passports back and insisted we collect them on checking out next day even though we had paid him in full. What a traumatising experience in a foreign land! We couldn’t leave the hotel as we had no ID and it was too late to find alternative accommodation. Only God knows what this man was doing with our passports overnight. The room (room 434) had terrible décor which was old and badly put together. The closet was painted black or dark brown inside! The bathroom had a shower but no enclosure so water splashed on the floor it was slippery everywhere after a shower. We couldn’t use the towels provided as they did not look clean at all. There was a double and a single bed in the room but the double bed was old and squeaky, obviously not fit for purpose. During the night someone was rolling what sounded like empty gas bottles down the stairs and sleep was quite simply impossible for a while. This is definitely my worst hotel experience to date.  Three Star hotel? That must be the joke of the year! For the price, we got worse than a raw deal. I have no intention of ever setting foot into this place again.…",1.0
"Yes, hotel needs major updating. Yes, the man at the front desk is not the prime example of hospitality. But all in all, this hotel did the job for us for the one night we were in Casablanca. Major pluses for being directly across a super market, for having great wifi (good enough to watch Netflix perfectly), and for being located near good non-moroccan restaurants. Bathroom is typically style with no tub so whole bathroom will get wet when you shower. Room SEEMED clean. liked having the balcony in the room. Taxi to airport will cost 240dirham. hotel was busy with lots of customers the night we stayed so that's a good sign.",3.0
"Overall, you get what you pay for. This is one of the cheapest options in the city of Casablanca, but that comes at a cost. The bed was as hard as a rock, and the rooms were generally not very clean. The man at the desk was irritated that we didn't speak French or Arabic, as he spoke no English so we couldn't ask for things to do or places to see as recommended by the hotel. The butler/staff are all very smiley and polite, and the breakfast that is put out is nice. It's a plain bread and a chocolate croissant, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea, milk, and oil or honey for dipping the bread into. It's not extensive, but it's yummy and filling. The bathroom left more to be desired, and I saw a cockroach that was pretty big the second night we stayed. When I go back to Casablanca, I won't be staying here.…",2.0

"My boyfriend and I stayed here one night. Upon checking in we paid 450 MAD, as it was their cheapest option. Before going to our room we notified the staff that we would leave the next morning at 7am; they told us that was fine and they would set breakfast out for us.   Our room was nice, it had two beds, AC, a TV and a small but functional bathroom. The cleaning staff brought us toilet paper, soap, shampoo and conditioner free of charge.   In the morning (just before 7am) there was no one at the desk and no breakfast set out. There were two people sleeping in the Lobby (possibly staff, I'm not sure). So, we set the key on the desk and left.  Accommodation in Casablanca is expensive compared to other places in Morocco like Taghazout, Imlil or Marrakech. But for 450 MAD I believe…",3.0

Strange stains of several colors on the bed sheets, scratches and dirt on the walls along with blood and dead mosquitoes, heavy grit and black moist on the bathroom sink. The floor was so dirty of black dirt and paper that I did not dare to touch it barefoot. On the negative side also the noise as the is no double glasses, the windows badly close, and the hotel is located in a crossroad. The hotel area is also quite dirty and uninspiring. Good side and reason for two stars: the staff is friendly and try to help, most of them at least, and WiFi worked in the room.…",2.0

She didn't give us a menu or ask what coffee we would like. She just presumed what we wanted and 10 mins later brought out the coffee. In fact, this is not the way we wanted our coffee, one sugar each was brought with the coffee. We asked for milk, the milk that was brought first time was expired.. i went and asked for a second one. She straight after brought the bill without asking if there is anything else we want. I am in hotel industry myself and even at a four star hotel i would not allow myself to give such a poor service to a customer. …",1.0
"Whenever you have the possibility to select a hotel in Casablanca just cross Hotel Washington out of the list. I spent one night at Hotel Washington just because Royal Air Maroc dropped me there after a missed flight connection. The hotel is incredibly noisy, at a corner of several busy streets. Noise insulation is virtually non-existent. The lobby is a strange mix of vintage 70's decoration and superficially renovated areas. This is actually one of the surprising things with this place. Management understands renovation as replacing tired items with new ones while most of the other old ones remain in place. The result is surprising: the bathroom and the room door were OK. All the rest, beds, furniture and especially the room walls was decrepit, worn-out and basically crap. The conclusion is straightforward. Forget the 4-star ranking. Hotel Washington needs full renovation but the owners probably don't care as long as Royal Air Maroc brings forced customers to them. Only 2 positive things to keep in mind: breakfast that I would rate as acceptable and the shower - hot and powerful.  That's pretty limited. As for the overall rating I was wondering whether Poor or Terrible better described such a terrible experience. I finally settled for Terrible. …",1.0

"I was shocked that this place is referred to as a 4-star hotel, I think they could market themselves much better as a 2 star hotel or even 1 star.  Anyhow, I was there for a layover and did not have the chance to use much of their services.  Somewhat of an indistinct hotel in downtown, nothing remarkable about the place. Rooms are fine but a bit drab and worn out. Seeing I did not pay for the room I cannot comment on the value.",3.0
"4 star hotel. It probably used to be it, but the standard is good enough. Clean bedsheets, convenient space and big window. It is a bit noisy.

To sum up, Washington is affordable place and good enough to stay here for one night.",4.0
"There may have been some time in the past 50 years this hotel earned 4 stars but it is impossible to imagine how. My wife and I travel 75% of the time, and I can remember few urban hotels this disappointing with this type of star rating.  We tried 4 different rooms before getting one halfway decent. In the first and second the A/C did not work. In the third the cigarette smoke was so bad our sinuses closed up. The sounds from the hallway and the room next door were not insulated at all.  The final room was tolerable in terms of cigarette smoke, but none of the four rooms were free from it. The A/C worked there okay. We were off the beaten path (room 215 - the _15 rooms are more insulated) but still could hear hallway noises (doors slamming, people calling to friends).  Room amenities were very lacking and there was no phone in the room. There was only one towel for two people so we had to find more, and not enough toilet paper. Fixtures were broken (e.g. a wall light fixture was just jagged edged glass).  Service at this hotel is almost non-existent. The front desk staff (except for one bright spot at our time of check out) show no interest to help.  It appears that this hotel is a dumping ground for airport passengers who miss their flight as shuttles drop and pick people up regularly. Most airport passengers are one-night guests so have little choice over their hotel.  There are many, many other options in Casablanca. Run, do not walk, from this place!…",1.0

Breakfast was gross:  stale pastries, cool/weak coffee, disgustingly sweet yogurt.  Not sure why our tour group uses this place as it is pretty much a dump.",1.0

My room smelled strongly of old wet shoes, there was a hole in the wall which had been stuffed with tissues as opposed to fixing it and the noise from the ""club"" downstairs until 3am every morning was deafening. It's not a bad location and the croissants at breakfast were fresh, but I'm not sure that's enough to warrant a recommendation.",1.0

Luckily it was the worst of the hotels in our tour, so things only got better.  The lobby's not too bad and the staff were friendly enough, but the rooms are in need of a definite upgrade.  There was also a bit of a smell happening, kind of musty and old.

I'd give this one a miss unless they make some major changes.",2.0

"We ended up staying at this hotel due to a booking hurdle. Because we read the online reviews before our arrival, we came with an open mind, accepting any surprises we might encounter.  The cigarette smoked hotel lobby displayed lots of antique-looking decorations - old paintings, copper statutes, marble details. It was as if we took the time machine and arrived at France in 1950s.  I was given a room key with a giant lead tag on the key chain – the tag was so heavy and oddly shaped that I felt uncomfortable to put it in my shorts pocket. Our room was a suite at the end of the ""third"" floor hallway. But we were told because of the elevator was not working atm, we had to take the stairs. As we climbed to the 2nd floor, we saw not lights at all in the entire floor. We climbed another floor and thought we were there, but then we noticed that all the room numbers were label as ""2xx"". So I quickly realized that the hotel must have shut down the entire 2nd floor and moved the floor numbers up! The dark hall way of ""the new 3rd floor"" had old furnitures and rolled up carpets lying all around it. And finally we were at our suite at the end of the hall!  Through the French door, a short hall led to a master bedroom and the secondary one, each of which had a small balcony, both open when we arrived. The curtains were flying into the rooms reluctantly. The secondary room had two twin beds jamming with each other and the belcony door. We couldn’t tell how long ago the beds were made, as the blankets on top were at least dusty.  Into the master bed there was a large full bathroom with a large window facing the street. Sink, bathtub, toilet, mirror, everything was well designed. You could tell that it must have been quite a luxury back in the days. The hot water took ages to run through, and the facet could never stop dripping. And one of the TVs had a tube.  At night back from dinner, as we walked through the stairs again, I wondered if the second floor was haunted. Back to the room, the balconies were lit by the neon from the club next door. I was woken up by a fight on the street at 3 am in the morning.  The next morning we were told that the elevator was back on, so we took it down for breakfast. I had to say this elevator marked with Otis, 1922 was probably the most marvelous one I have ever seen. The lights and art printed on the wall showed the status of this place in its prime time.  By the time of checkout, I actually didn’t feel dismayed by our stay, but wondered what was it like when this hotel was at its glory? And what caused its fall? Why couldn’t they acquire necessary financing opportunities to preserve and renovate this place?…",2.0
It is absolutely gorgeous example of Casablanca’s Art Deco legacy. Inside it is worn out and you can only sense it’s glorious past.

"I stayed here on the night of 23 December 2017 in room 316.   There were rolled up carpets outside my room which would have been an impediment in an emergency.  The room was very spacious as was the bathroom and all seemed well until about 02:00 hrs. when people started leaving the club downstairs with its entrance underneath my room.  This resulted in arguments, shouting, cars starting etc, until 05:00 hrs., after which time I was able to get about two hours sleep before I had the hotel's offering of a bland breakfast which matched the blandness of the previous night's dinner. I had to use the power point in the bathroom as there were no others.  Other travellers on our tour were even more unfortunate, because not only did they experience the high noise level outside but they had to endure the smell coming from the sewerage system in the bathroom.    According to the itinerary of our KRAS 'Highlights of Morocco' tour, we should have stayed at the Hotel Prince de Paris, but nobody gave us an explanation as to why we changed hotels.  When driving away from the Transatlantique in our tour bus, we saw the Prince de Paris and it was located in a quieter area.   This was my second example of budget style accommodation and food that KRAS was offering in it 'Highlights of Morocco' tour.…",2.0

I arrived to casablanca a day prior to the start and was debating staying here - based on the reviews prior I decided not to and I am very happy I made that decision. The hotel room was one of the dirtiest on the whole tour and the pillow and bed extremely uncomfortable. The bathroom wasn’t very clean and personally I wouldn’t have felt comfortable showering there.

Wifi worked perfectly in my room (206), the only sounds I heard was the cooing of pigeons. The bed was as firm as I've ever had but that's fine. The 'pillow' was a rock hard 'bolster' - that was a bit hard to adjust to. The breakfast was the usual Arabic fare - olives, tomatoes, cucumber, boiled eggs, some unidentified processed meat and white, spreadable cheese (if you could call it that) in foil packs. The best thing was fresh baguettes, apricot and cherry jam. Didn't try the coffee but the orange 'juice' was definitely orange 'drink'. The interior was fabulously quirky!

Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable, despite the bedding not really fitting the bed, the TV not working, and the fridge (we would never see another in a Moroccan hotel room) wasn't very cold. The shower was good but the water was tepid - maybe it's hot at night (more a French thing) - but we were OK with warmish.

Advise, invest in some basic principals (clean glasses, good beds etc) and you have a good hotel.",2.0
"At the time, certainly a chique hotel what you can still see and feel. Could have been renovated, true, but has an atmosphere. Breakfast was poor, but still better than in any other hotel where I have stayed during two weeks trip. Apparently, Moroccans have an issue with breakfast. French school, I would say.",4.0
"It was the dirtiest Hotel i ever seen in my life, the smell was just horrible in the room and bathroom smells worst my bed sheet was full of spam & food  I don't advice any one to try it + the price is not the same as the put online you can see the towel condition in the pic",1.0
"Stayed here for one night when the other hotel booked was not found on the road! Average place with recommended renovation, only good thing is proximity to the Train Station. Owner was good - gave me some useful information by doing some research in internet which I had some issues to navigate due to language.",3.0
"Sooo... my friend booked our stay here because it was close to the train station (Casa Voyagers) and we would only be there one night.  I was slightly terrified at first after reading reviews but in all honesty my experience wasn't that bad.  There are no elevators and you will have to lug whatever you have up slightly narrow stairs.  The check-in area is also very narrow.  It's beautiful though.  I mean I was surprised at how good looking it was in person.  The room was clean.  The beds were broken but we could sleep on them.  The sheets were clean even if the extra blankets were not.  The bathroom was awkward (especially the shower) but clean.  They provided us with hand soap, toilet paper and towels.    The WiFi was non-existent.  I mean even though they showed us which was the WiFi and the password, most times you couldn't even find it on your list.    Check out was easy.  Just handed them cash and said bye.…",3.0
"I needed a place to stay in at Casablanca, and I found this one to be nearest the bus station and the Casa Voyageur train station. I never read reviews because I was in a hurry, and I was expecting it will be the same or even better than the riads/hostels I stayed in Morocco. To my disappointment, there's no aircon so you have to open the window for air. The toilet is dirty, and the overall interior is just in bad condition.",1.0
"Hotel Boustance is very old but only a few mins walk from Casa Voyageurs railway station as well as close to a tram station and it is very cheap. It is old and the bed sheets are not clean and you can easily find hair on them. There is no towels or toilet rolls in the room.The washing basin is leaking such that you will always need to step on a pool of water and the water tap can easily get the whole body wet because of malfunctioning. The toilet is leaking such that you can hear water running the whole night.There is a little balcony but the door cannot be locked which means that anyone can easily climb in from outside as houses are very close to each other. But, for such a low price and the location, I have no complaint. The staff are ok and the Wifi works well.  I cannot carry the luggage up the stairs and the staff took it up for me. I think it is not too bad for 1 night stay for those on low budget. At least, there is no ants or cockroaches.…",2.0
"Good location if you are planning to take the train, close to the Casa-Voyageurs railway station and not so far from the Hassan II Mosque, around 10 min by/ 4 euros.  The man from the desk, which I suppose was the owner was very nice, helpful and friendly, 5 stars for him. Room wasn't so bad but the bathroom looked like it wasn't cleaned for a while. No chance to get a shower and of course after seeing that we start to question the room cleanliness.  Hopefully, things will get better.",2.0
"These guys shouldn't be in the hotel business. Our reservation was cancelled on the day we planned to arrive, with notification sent when we were on the plane. We woke up a receptionist (not sure if he was drunk but he looked like) only to hear that our room was given to somebody else - and they were surprised that we were upset. Avoid this place!",1.0
"After reading other reviews I was wary of this place but decided to check it out. The poor reviews seem very overstated. The hotel is three blocks and very easy walking distance from the train station. It is reasonably priced. The rooms have no heating or cooling but have high ceiings and are huge. Our room had a queen size bed and a double bed as well as a sofa. The TV was old but the staff came twice to personally tune the TV to the only English cable channel for us. The receptionist was always helpful and cheerful. The wifi was fast and handled two devices at once in our room. The plumbing worked well with great hot showers. The decor is old and mismatched but the sheets were very clean and in good condition, the towels were OK. We found the hotel quiet and had a great nights sleep.…",3.0
"I spent a full  week in this hotel, which gave me the opportunity to try in full its capacity to accomodate travelers in search for a budget hotel.One cannot deny the easy location near the train station and the tramway which cross casa from one side to the other, right by the oceanic shore. Every floor has an independent wifi router which works perfectly for the connection inside the rooms. The place is a come and go of people, but not so noisy and you can rest ok, accepting the cleanness standard of such old hotel, which probably it has not changed mattress in the rooms  from the day of inauguration, but if you are smell fetishist, you may like that particular nitrite odor coming from beneath the bed sheets, which btw they are usually fresh washed and clean. Unfortunately the hotel need some hands of maintenance, because although the hot water is available, the piping in which it flows was leaking from the ceiling of the bathroom.  I can recommend for overnight for longer time I suggest you to inspect the facility to avoid late surprises.…",3.0

"The worst hotel I've ever been in. Dirty, neglected, linen looked like used many times before. Pictures on booking.com must have been taken 20 years ago or photoshoped by a master.

"The location is the only thing that mattered when I stayed there. I had a good sleep though. Close the windows and/or use earplugs. You are in Casablanca, it is noisy. The room was large but mouldy (ceiling, bathroom). Water was hot though. I did not have any breakfast.",3.0
I was not expecting something of 4 or 5 star hotels but for the price you got what you paid. Casablanca is not that cheap city to enjoy Marocco but this place is the cheapest option for one night stay and walking distance from Gare du Train. However the man in the front reception doesnt speak English but he does understand well. The rooms are very cold and not the cleanest one... but okay for one night stay.,2.0
"For my opinion  they could improve a lot if the quality of cleaning and arrangements such as lights, cortinas pf shower change.

"Large and romantic old town, it was great my dreams when I arrived to Casablanca. The hotel was expecting a haven of peace. Vacation time was two weeks. The first week went to the city exploring, but the second week was already longing-filled, that is, out of the entire town. Too much and unnecessary romance throughout Casablanca. I was disappointed. The hotel was also very tedious. The bed was horrible, pillows and blankets were dirty and were not changed throughout the course. Noise from the street and neighboring room the sounds of the residents continued late into the night. The only positive was the staff, thanks to them !!!",2.0
"The Guy at the reception asked us to pay up front, and after we've stayed the night we know why! The shower was broken, the door/window couldn't close so we had to listen to all the streetnoise trough out the night and worst of all, the room and halls were occupied by cockroaches! When we complianed about the cockroaches at the reception, they told us to get used to it...this is why the guy at the reception asked to pay up front...he must have known we wouldn't pay if we already had stayed there.",1.0
"I would not recommend this hotel, the rooms were not clean, hair and dirt in the bathroom and stains on the sheets. We stayed one night and quickly moved to a different hotel.  Not worth the price! also they only have 1 remote for the air conditioning and will come in  and set it for you, but later if you get too cold you are out of luck!",2.0

"I had a long layover in Casablanca and needed a cheap hotel. I booked Hotel du Louvre on Hotels.com for like $48. The place is not the Hilton but it's charming, adequate, clean and even as a single female at 10pm, I felt safe. I had a room on the street and it was a little noisy if you like a really quiet room-- I tend to like some street sounds though and it was fine. There was hot water but the hot water heater is super small so its enough for a quick shower.",4.0
"This hotel was fine for a night or two. This was the beginning of a two week trip accross the country and our expectations were low. Beds were comfortable and the location was good for visiting the medina, mosque Hassan 2, etc. The area is noisy, but with jet lag and ear plugs, we managed to sleep through breakfast the first morning. Breakfast is in another hotel not very close by and the staff made it obvious they were not happy to show us where it was. Service is minimal but so is the rate.",2.0
"visited Casablanca in january 2011, chose the hotel of its price. well, for stay it is ok, but not for living!  First, it is hard to find the hotel. taxi driver spent a lot of time asking directions Second, all in a room  is old and partially broken Third, the breakfast is served in another hotel and it is really poor. Terrible tea, no fresh juice, too few vegetables, and 1 or 2 muffins. Guys, that is not enough!  The only advantage - the location, close to medina",3.0
"Difficult to find, our taxi driver asked about this hotel many people and other drivers, nobody knew street Rue Nationale, about 30 min we found it.

Heatening of hot water for shower is not central. Only one towel for two people (double room). There is breakfast, but in other hotel. Staff showed us way to this hotel. We came to breakfast in diffirent time, but always there was too few to eat. Orange juice was not original (we were in morocco one week, it's orange land and all hotel beside that hotel provided us for breakfast with glass of fresh orange juce).

"I've spent the last two decades traveling for work, often to the developing world.  So, I understand that travlers expectations should shift a bit in accordance with local standards of 'luxury.'  However, the Hotel du Louvre is an abysmal hotel by any concievable standard.  The staff is rude, and at times openly hostile.  One of them even rifled through my things while I was out for meetings, although nothing was stolen.  While the lobby is very appealing and quite clean, the same cannot be said for the rooms.  They have a sort of faded glory because of some nice architectural touches, such as crown molding, but the paint job is peeling, the carpets are threadbare and filthy, and the bathroom smells of feces.  The room that I saw and booked online simply does not exist at this…",1.0
"we booked at 9 p.m. and gave us one price that was ok for us. when we got in with all baggages he changed   his mind asking for 170 dirham more (the prices in the reception said 280 for single, 380 for double and for the triple room he finally asked 550!!).  it was late and we said we'll discuss later. in the early morning the same waiter said he didn't want to discuss 'cause he had headache.. but we had it too because of lot of mosquitos and flies in the room. and with rude manners he made us wait for half on hour for the receipt.  bad!!",1.0
"We’re not the type of people to make a huge fuss about a hotel BUT this was something else.  This was the most disgusting hotel we’ve ever come across. We booked the hotel for two nights but had to leave after one.  -The whole hotel was just was dirty, and definitely needs a reno, there was an awful smell throughout it.  - The only clean aspect of our room was the sheets, the floor had dirt everywhere, the bathroom had clearly not been cleaned very thoroughly. There was dirt, hair and I don’t know what else in the sink and no hot water when we took a shower. Not to mention the bathroom door didn’t close.  - There were drops of dried BLOOD on our floor which was disgusting.  - The breakfast area was not clean when we went down for breakfast (juice and crumbs all over the tables and chairs),  the butter we had was mouldy and there were people touching all the food to find the right one for them.  Honestly would not recommend this place AT ALL. In a super creepy out of the way neighbourhood, I felt quite unsafe as a woman in the hotel itself, as there were lots of single or small groups of men there who would stare at me.  Please don’t stay here.…",1.0
"Everything. The place is very grim, dark and dirty. Is an old place that is not well maintained. When we checked in the room was very dirty, we asked again to be cleaned as was unbelievable for a 3 stars hotel. The next day I went to ask for the payment back that was made in advance for 5 nights. We got a big refuse but they were willing to swap the room. Can't say more about the fact that even with a swap the conditions were terrible. There is a constant sweerage smell in the bathrooms! We decided to spend two nights on a different place as we couldn't stay 5 nights in this place! On our return for the last night we saw that our shampoo and bottles of water that we left in the room were missing.... As a last note, worst experience had in a hotel/motel/hostel/airbnb!

"We stayed here for three nights, and enjoyed our stay. But before, must say, getting there by car, not knowing the place, at least for us, was a disaster.   The hotel is along a one way road, so if you miss it, like we did, you have go all around the block, through a heavily used roundabout. Not enough clear signs or where to hotel is. But the most annoying part, was the parking. We were first waived down by a ""park guide"". We pointed out a spot for the car, almost in front of the hotel, on the pavement. He told it would be 60MAD for our stay, which I thought was reasonable. He also told us that there is a parking place under ground just right next to us, but its more expensive (pointer here, this was a lie, it was the same price). I asked him if he was sure the car is ok here, and without any hotel staff member to be seen, I left the car where it was. No surprise, as I was checking in, I asked about the car, and they said that no, I could not leave it there, and should drive it to the under ground. Its right next to the hotel, but there are no markings, signs or anything. I drove the car down a very steep narrow corridor. Friendly staff at the parking place, but just too much of a hassle for a professional hotel. Leaving the under ground wasnt easy either, the slope being so steep, by rental car couldnt make it up. Eventually one staff member suggested he drives it up, which he did, but at the same time burning my clutch and screeching my tyres. But hat off, he got it up.. And no, the first ""park guide"" did not give me anything back, because I already paid. Avoid them around this hotel, since you have the other option available. If you must park on the road, just pay for max one hour or so first. The underground is paid to the reception.  Okay, now onto the actual hotel.  The good: Extremely friendly staff, only hotel during our trip where our luggage was carried up (I usually insist on carrying my own), but this guy, sorry dont recall his name, was just a real gentleman and sweetheart. Location itself was a bit far from the main attractions, around the hotel there was a couple very good cafes and a little market area just down the road with fresh foods and cakes etc. The room had good air conditioning. The breakfast was very nice, just for some reason the tea tasted horrible, but it could just be me. A very nice pizzeria/crepperia on the lower floor, open until 10pm if I recall correctly.  The bad: The parking episode. That really annoyed me and I hope the hotel tries to fix this and approve it. Also the shower, typical in the hotels we'd stayed, this wasnt any different, no drain in the bathroom, only in the shower itself. So all the water dripping off the edge etc, just stayed on the floor, becoming very wet, and not going anywhere. Yes, the cleaner would dry the floor when they cleaning the room, but just for overall sake of the condition of the bathroom, a second drain would be a good idea. The view wasnt too great, but the hotel cant really help that.  Overall: Very pleasent hotel, but be weary if coming by car.…",4.0
"Arrival a day early before the start of my tour to northern Morocco. I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and thought they provided good customer service.

There are lots of little shops nearby for fruits, snacks and food. ",5.0
"I stayed here one night as a tour. When I turned up, it seemed part of the ceiling had fallen down - well there was a big hole with cables hanging out. Not the best first impression.  Room was ok, but my room mate who had arrived earlier had come across a large cockroach running around the bathroom. Very dark room and just not one you would want to spend much time in.  Shower was hot, but pressure not great.   Breakfast actually not that bad - nice pastries and ok coffee.   Would I stay again...unlikely.",2.0
Room is ok but bathroom was looking old and slightly rusty. Walls are thin so you canTV and music from next room. Location is not good as the area around it looks ugly and it's far off from the main landmarks. Worst thing was when someone tried to get into my room - unsure how that happened. ,1.0

Seemed as though noise was in the evening and morning though rather than whole way through the night.   Breakfast is fine - standard for Morocco, breads, jam, coffee. Luckily they do offer breakfast otherwise you'd be completely stuck as there is nothing else nearby.   Facilities are good and rooms are clean.

"If you are looking for a cheap lodging option in Casablanca, the Hotel Colisee is definitely a good option to consider.   The Colisee is conveniently located within the city centre, at a short distance from the city's main attraction. It is mainly a transit hotel, so clients are many and they generally stay for no more than 1-3 nights.   The hotel is basic, but overall well managed. The personnel at the reception is kind and attentive, rooms have a decent size and come with A/C and TV. The hotel is clean and WiFi is available (and works) within the rooms.   Breakfast is basic, but that's a common feature throughout Morocco. Pancakes, pastries, bread, eggs are the things to choose from, together with the usual tea and coffee (no fruits). There is a buffet, so you can refill as much as you can.  The downside of the hotel is that rooms and guests are many, so the place can be noisy, although this does not happen all the time. One night we were woken up by the screams of a family argument going on in the corridor, just outside our door.   Overall, though, we would definitely consider the Colisee for another stay, should we go back to Casablanca.…",3.0

"I am a person that travels a LOT on budget, so i don't really mind less comfy places as long as it is a cheap sleep. However Colisee relies a lot on the price so they don't do anything to make us have a nice stay.  First of all, we booked a triple room, which in the pictures had lots of space, but upon arriving, we were given a very small double room, where the door wouldn't even open fully due to the bed.  The elevator is extremely small, if you have luggage either you take turns taking the luggage upstairs or you go by stairs. However, in one of the days, the lift was not even working.  Ants. Lots and lots of ants in the room. Dozens of them feasting on a half spider corpse, which was the proof that no one took the time to clean the room.  On the first night, for 2 persons, only one towel was provided. We asked for another one at the reception and they told us it would be delivered to us either on the same day or in the early morning next day. It never came. Worst part, after the ""cleaning"" lady came to our room while we were out, not only she didn't leave any towels as she took our old ones, so this time we were left without a single towel.  The shower is open, like in most parts of morocco, which is fine by me. However, due to a strange shape of the floor, the water was flowing out of the bathroom and in the bed's direction. The door has a flap to prevent the water from passing under the door, but it only works until you have to open the door, and at this point when you try to close the door, it will push all the water towards the room, creating a small lake by the bed.  Out room was located beneath the restaurant, and even with the windows closed, we always had a strong smell of food (fried food) in the room during the night.  Breakfast was nice, fresh bread, eggs, butter etc, but pancakes tasted like someone has been using the same cooking oil since the hotel opened and the coffee was awful, badly filtered.  Don't get me wrong, during my entire stay in Morocco i stayed in different Riads, many of them small and a bit dark, but they were all capable of providing a clean and friendly environment. I'm not picky, i just think Colisee is not really a hotel, it's just a building with a bunch of rooms that no one cleans or services, but they charge you for it and expect everything to be fine just the way it is.

"I definitely do NOT recommend this Hotel. We arrived and the stuff had problems to find our reservation. We booked one room, which turned out to be two. We were first positive, but the rooms were so small, we could not open the door because there was a bad in the way. All that would be okay, but when we opened the window, it turned out it leads to the kitchen, so the whole room smelled like french fries and third-degree Moroccian food. Which, I suppose, attracted the army of ants wandering on our bed and floor and walls and basically everything. The bin in the ""bathroom"" was not emptied and there was hair all over the place. If I knew the word ""mould"" before in English I would have complained about that too. At least I enlarged my vocabulary. The blankets were dirty and I was really scared to touch anything. The positive is that the stuff was really helpful and offered us another room with only half of the ant population. Another nice thing was that they offered us relatively cheap parking for which we got a fine and a tire shoe at the end of the day. The breakfast did not give us diarhoeha, but the coffee definitely tasted like one. I guess it was just an intensive experience I do not need to have twice.…",1.0

部屋には ドライヤーがない。 ペットボトルや飲料設備がない。 初日はテレビがつかない。 トイレットペーパーはポンとむき出しにおいてあるだけ。 全体的に設備が古く、鍵をガチャガチャ回す音や話し声がよく聞こえてくる。 景色も良くない。 朝食も種類が少なく、まぁ、食べられはする、というレベル。 これで星4つ？つい、星の数を数え直したくらい。  しいていえば、biolamという、PCR検査を受けられる施設まで徒歩で行けるのがいい点。(それでも徒歩15分くらいだが) もう利用することはないだろう。,2.0

"As a two friends we stayed a night by “Booking.com”. The only positive thing that I can say is that the hotel located near to the city center.   The linens were clean, the wise man in the reception (!) (he also has a talent to give ideas and get commissions) was helpful. That’s all.  I think to seek alternatives is a good way in Casablanca.

Tried two other addresses for this hotel (iPhone maps and Google maps), all took me to places with no hotel.  Wasted over three hours trying to locate it and never could.

"Booked two rooms through Expedia and prepaid for them. The address Expedia listed took us to a very scary neighborhood, no hotel. Looked up the hotel on  iPhone maps, got a different address that took us to the middle of a crammed urban neighborhood in Casa, no hotel. Looked up the hotel on Google maps, got a different address that took us to the port in the heart of downtown Casa, an empty lot with a fence around it and no hotel. Tried calling multiple times and the number was disconnected. Contacted Expedia who also tried calling and also had a disconnected number. Wasted over three hours on my last night in Morocco trying to find this place before we gave up and paid for a different hotel near the airport; when we got there, received a phone call through WhatsApp supposedly from the hotel. My Moroccan traveling companion exchanged harsh words with the woman who called, and I’m not entirely sure what was said because by that time I was in the middle of an anxiety attack. Expedia’s customer service was not helpful (after 45 minutes of them attempting to reconcile the situation I gave up). Expedia requested a refund from the hotel but the hotel refused, despite the fact that we were not to locate the premises nor contact them at all. Frankly, I am not sure this hotel even exists and I believe it is a scam. Don’t waste your time or money.…",1.0

Aucune réponse  Nous avons même essayé d'appeler  Pas de réponse   Nous arrivons ce soir à l'hôtel qui nous informe que nos chambres ont été réservées et que l'hôtel est complet!!!!!!   On nous envoie dans un hôtel miteux où je ne poserai même pas ma tête sur l'oreiller   Comment, alors que notre réservation est confirmée, nos chambres ont-elles pu se retrouver réservées par d'autres??? Leur excuse est que nous avons loupé l'heure de check-in qui est jusqu'à 16h (bien que nous avions averti de notre heure d'arrivée)  Or sur le site je vois qu'il se fait de 00h a 16h effectivement. Donc vu l'heure nous aurions pu avoir le check-in pour notre réservation du 23/10 à défaut d'avoir celle du 22/10 si je suis la logique.

"This is a great place to stay, particularly at the end of your trip.  It is quite outside of the main areas of the city, so keep in mind it will likely cost about 200 Durhams from downtown and can be about an hour by taxi pending traffic (the front desk staff actually helped us from getting overcharged for the taxi ride).  If you still had some sightseeing to do I would stay more downtown, but for a nice peaceful place to stay to relax it was perfect!  The actual hotel is very nice and clean!  The pool is well maintained, the WiFi good, the food great and the staff are very friendly.

A fairly plain hotel in noisy commercial surroundings. Nowhere to go for a walk except the hotel garden. Smallish room with very comfortable bed. Took ages to get the hot water working but finally the owner came to our assistance and pointed out the labels on the taps were accidentally reversed... The wifi was not working much during our stay as the cable had apparently been cut. This meant that the card machine would not work at checkout time...
